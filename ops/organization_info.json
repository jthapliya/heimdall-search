Attune is a highly visual web application built on open source technologies.  \n\nTo cost-effectively maintain and modernize their capabilities, organizations must identify where to make intelligent cuts and consolidation, where to develop new capabilities to fill gaps, and how to integrate what is left in ways that improve mission performance.\n\n##### TRACING MISSION CAPABILITIES REQUIREMENTS\n\nAttune enables you to perform enterprise design activities and determine the mission, common, and core services needed to make intelligent trade-off analyses and to do open architecture design.\n- __Mission-Driven__ - Missions cross organizations so it is critical to provide full traceability and visibility of systems, activities, and requirements to mission needs. This is the foundation for optimizing capabilities and mission readiness; changes must be quantifiable via clear mission impact\n- __Enterprise Perspective__ \u2014 To deliver integrated system-of-systems (SoS)\nthat meet mission requirements, leaders need to understand capability/system gaps and redundancies across organizational boundaries to make more informed decisions on intelligent technology injection and/or convergence. From the enterprise perspective, the government should take an \u201cABCD\u201d approach when it comes to technology\u2014adopt first, buy second, create third, and decommission fourth\n- __Open Source Architecture__ \u2014To drive out inefficiencies, the US government needs to own the architecture, the system, and the data to reduce vendor lock-in. In addition, the government needs to create modular architecture with open/interoperable, well-defined interfaces to plug in new technologies when they become available, fostering innovation\nand reuse across the enterprise\n\nAttune is a highly visual, open source web application that provides a true enterprise environment for application/ service portfolio management and enterprise\ndesign. Attune helps you to:\n\n- __Define and Visualize Your Portfolio__ - Understand the massive amount of\ndata in your enterprise portfolio through interactive and intuitive data visualizations.\nThen ask:\n  - What are the mission, common, and core services across my enterprise so I can make consolidation decisions?\n  - Where do I have gaps that need to be addressed?\n\n- __Trace Portfolio Relationships__ - Understand connections of program support and the relevancy to missions and capabilities, enabling impact assessment of decisions\n- __Define System and Service Specifications__ - View and manage system and service\nspecifications across the whole enterprise. Specifications provide the blueprint for implementation\n- __Quantify Your Portfolio__ - Quickly view and find what assets you have and their detailed information, identify potential gaps and duplication, and see the cost and acquisition information tied to the systems. Then ask:\n  - Should I build or buy?\n  - Does it make sense for me to reuse certain systems?\n\n- __Perform Trade-Off Analysis__ - Perform what-if analysis to determine trade-offs of different courses of actions to ensure mission readiness is still maintained by different decision scenarios. For example:\n  - Will I still be able to meet mission demands after making certain cuts?\n  - How can I best optimize my capabilities given the current funding?\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n### Tech\n\nAttune uses a number of open source projects to work properly:\n\n* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) - HTML, CSS, and JS framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web\n* [Cytoscape.js](http://js.cytoscape.org/) - JS library for drawing graphs \n* [D3.js](http://d3js.org/) - JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data.\n* [Inflection.js](https://code.google.com/p/inflection-js/) - Library for correctly pluralizing strings \n* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) -HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation\n* [jQuery.editable-select.js](https://github.com/indrimuska/jquery-editable-select) - Library to transform normal select element into an editable one with suggestions\n* [Sortable.js](https://github.com/RubaXa/Sortable) - JS library that allows the user to rearrange list items via drag n\u2019 drop \n* [Vis.js/vis.css](http://visjs.org/) - Timeline library \n* [Simple-sidebar.css](https://github.com/IronSummitMedia/startbootstrap-simple-sidebar) -A bootstrap friendly sidebar \n* [accounting.js](http://openexchangerates.github.io/accounting.js/) -Library to format strings/numbers to be represented as accounting strings with a currency and decimals\n* [Guava](https://github.com/google/guava) - Java library used to do some arithmetic on Sets (and other data structures)\n* [evo-inflector](https://github.com/atteo/evo-inflector) - Java library used to pluralize strings\n* [Bootstrap Hover Dropdown](https://github.com/CWSpear/bootstrap-hover-dropdown) - Bootstrap plugin that allows dropdowns to be enabled by hover rather than click.\n\n\n### Installation\n\nFor full details on how to install and use Attune, please request access to the [Booz Allen wiki page](https://collab.boozallenet.com/confluence/display/FLEX/Attune).\n","stars":0,"contributors_list":[{"username":"526301","avatar_url":null,"user_type":"Anonymous","profile_url":null},{"username":"579881","avatar_url":null,"user_type":"Anonymous","profile_url":null},{"username":"reif-ben","avatar_url":"https://avatars.github.boozallencsn.com/u/577?","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.boozallencsn.com/reif-ben"},{"username":"579881","avatar_url":null,"user_type":"Anonymous","profile_url":null},{"username":"527184","avatar_url":null,"user_type":"Anonymous","profile_url":null},{"username":"580293","avatar_url":null,"user_type":"Anonymous","profile_url":null},{"username":"578291","avatar_url":null,"user_type":"Anonymous","profile_url":null},{"username":"asare-patrick","avatar_url":"https://avatars.github.boozallencsn.com/u/584?","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.boozallencsn.com/asare-patrick"},{"username":"574548","avatar_url":null,"user_type":"Anonymous","profile_url":null},{"username":"norrie-jane","avatar_url":"https://avatars.github.boozallencsn.com/u/585?","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.boozallencsn.com/norrie-jane"},{"username":"574548","avatar_url":null,"user_type":"Anonymous","profile_url":null}],"forks":0,"organization_url":"https://github.boozallencsn.com/DIGITAL-ACCT-GROUP","project_name":"attune","org_avatar_url":"https://avatars.github.boozallencsn.com/u/190?","repository":"attune","commits":762,"readme_url":"https://raw.github.boozallencsn.com/DIGITAL-ACCT-GROUP/attune/master/README.md?token=AAAA2woeu8sOIVHzaWuAp9CLxqaa4CbUks5X_4xZwA%3D%3D","watchers":4,"language":"JavaScript","org_type":"Organization","organization":"DIGITAL-ACCT-GROUP"}

As well as these generic cross-cutting concerns, there are also cross-cutting concerns that are specific to the application in use such as alerting/notification, search and data discovery. Organizations spend significant amounts of time integrating vendor solutions to meet their mission needs. Each of these vendor products may handle these cross-cutting concerns in a unique, non-standard fashion. This can cost organization significant time and money to integrate this core functionality.\n\nThe Service DialTone (SDT) suite of core enterprise infrastructure services provides the core foundational \"harness\" to address these cross-cutting concerns that present challenges to service development and interoperability. By abstracting away these cross-cutting concerns the SDT lessens the implementation burden on developers enabling organizations and their vendors to focus more of their time on mission-specific services and applications.  \n\n##### CROSS-CUTTING REQUIREMENTS\nThe SDT takes care of the cross-cutting demands common with a service development. In doing so the SDT provides core interoperability by enabling organizations to access services and share data as described in the following requirements:\n- __Unanticipated User__ - Users and services may need access to mission services without a-priori knowledge and setup. This includes the explicit exchange of consumer/provider certificates as well as the population of user attributes and credentials by target services\n- __Access Control__ - Access to services are granted on based on the requesting user/system attributes and the access control policy defined for the requested service\n- __Runtime Discovery__ - Services should be able to deployed and discoverable by clients automatically. If a service is relocated it should be discovered automatically by clients\n- __Proactive Monitoring__ - The current and past \"health\" of a service should be available. If a service status changes system administrators should be alerted\n- __User and Usage Analysis__ - Metrics should be gathered and calculated for service performance and user activity tracking. Some common metrics are:\n  - Number of Requests -  The total number of service invocations received\n  - Number of Successful Requests - The number of service invocations received and processed successfully\n  - Number of Unsuccessful Requests - The number of service invocations received and not processed successfully\n  - Average Response Time - An average of the service response times\n  - Maximum Response Time - The maximum service invocation response time\n  - Last Response Time - The response time of the last service invocation\n  - Uptime - The amount of time since the last known system failure\n  - Status History - The history of \"health\" checks for a service\n- __Alerting__ - Services have the ability to selectively disseminate notification of events of interest\n\n\n##### CROSS-CUTTING CAPABILITIES\nThe SDT suite of services delivers the functionality to address the cross-cutting requirements listed above. Each of these services implement a series of design patterns based on standards adopted by industry, government and academia.\n- __Identity and Access Management__ - Enables uniform authentication for users across multiple applications and provides security authorization to services and data\n- __Service Discovery__ \u2014 Provides automatic discovery of services across a given network\n- __Audit Logging__ \u2014 Logs details about each service call including who made the request, where from, were they granted access and the response returned. Used for metrics calculations\n- __Monitoring__ \u2014 Performs \"health\" checks against services to determine status. A history of the service status is kept to calculate uptime and potential compare a service against a Service Level Agreement (SLA)\n- __Metrics__ \u2014 Provides analytics for service usage and user activity/pattern analysis\n- __Notification__ \u2014 Provides lightweight, messaging capability to enable the publishing and consuming of events/alerts\n\n\n### Technology Stack\nThe SDT uses a number of open source projects to work properly:\n\n* [Spring](http://projects.spring.io/spring-framework/) -General application development framework\n* [Jetty](http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/) - Lightweight web server hosting for majority of services\n* [PicketLink](http://picketlink.org/) - Java Library to perform XACML processing for access control \n* [OpenESM](https://www.army.mil/article/65084/Army_researchers_support_joint_experiment_to_speed_communications_using_open_source_technology) - Open source metrics/monitoring platform provided by ARMY CERDEC.\n* [Apache CXF](http://cxf.apache.org/) - Framework for alerting and notification \n* [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) - General persistence/database storage\n* [PostgrsSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) - Used specifically for OpenESM\n\n\n### Installation\n\nFor full details on how to install and use SDT, please request access to the [Booz Allen wiki page](TBD).\n","stars":0,"contributors_list":[{"username":"simmons-andre","avatar_url":"https://avatars.github.boozallencsn.com/u/649?","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.boozallencsn.com/simmons-andre"}],"forks":0,"organization_url":"https://github.boozallencsn.com/DIGITAL-ACCT-GROUP","project_name":"Service-DialTone-Prototype","org_avatar_url":"https://avatars.github.boozallencsn.com/u/190?","repository":"Service-DialTone-Prototype","commits":1,"readme_url":"https://raw.github.boozallencsn.com/DIGITAL-ACCT-GROUP/Service-DialTone-Prototype/master/README.md?token=AAAA29t_7jBBmt-5HuHDd03NVtsoFfyGks5X_4xZwA%3D%3D","watchers":3,"language":null,"org_type":"Organization","organization":"DIGITAL-ACCT-GROUP"}

Install Node.js globally\n2. Install NPM globally\n3. Install MongoDB globally.  \n   It's recommended you use a configuration file to set the directories where MongoDB will log and store data.\n   A sample configuration file has been included in this repo as   'mongodb.conf.sample'.\n4. Clone this repository into whichever directory you'd like to use for the project.\n5. Install the NPM dependencies  \n\t$ npm install\n6. Start mongodb (use the path for your config file)  \n\t$ mongod --config /usr/local/Cellar/mongodb/2.6.7/mongodb.conf\n7. Install Gulp globally (if you like, if you don't you'll need to reference the local install whenever you run it)  \n\t$ npm install --global gulp  \n8. Run gulp and wait for the build to finish  NOTE:  when you see \"Finished 'default' after xx ms\" gulp has completed executing.  It is now \"watching\" for file changes.\n\t$ gulp\n9. Optional: if you want to seed your environment with development test data you can run the devseed.js script:\n\t$ MONGO_URL=mongodb://localhost/kaizen node devseed.js\n   This will load all the updates in the test/updates directory\n    In addition, a bash script has been created \"reseedMongo.sh\" that will handle this for you.\n10. Start keystone.js  \n\t$ node keystone\n11. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/ and observe that the site loads succesfully (hopefully)\n    You can login using: \n    \tusername: Super Admin\n    \tpassword: pass2222\n12. Note:  There are other users defined in the system when you run the devseed, they will all be\n    broken, as their are being created without encryption.  Once logged in as the Super Admin,\n    you can create another account with full privileges for yourself, then safely delete all\n    the extraneous accounts.\n\nENVIRONMENTS\n===\n\n* The development server:  http://dev.boozallencybersim.com/login\n    NOTE:  Currently offline\n\n* The staging server: http://staging.boozllencybersim.com/login\n    NOTE:  On stagine, you can add \"?action=test\" to the URL to bypass the Google 2FA\n  Username:  super admin\n  Password:  pass2222\n\nUSEFUL RESOURCES\n===\n\n*  Interactive mockups from the client:  http://gator4194.hostgator.com/~foamcube/inprogress/talent4sight/core_index/core.html\n\n* Jira board (as of 2016/09/07):\nhttps://jira.boozallencsn.com/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=52\n\n* Confluence boards (two, as of 2016/09/07):\nNew:  https://confluence.usae.bah.com:8443/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=18645389\nOld:  https://confluence.boozallencsn.com/display/CYB/CyberSIM\n\n\nADDING A CLIENT SIDE LIBRARY\n====\n\nKaizen is using Bower to manage client side libraries and Require.js to manage dependencies in the browser. \nbower.json contains all the dependencies. Currently, \nthe bower_components are copied to the public/lib directory via the gulp task \"bower\". So, to add a new library \n do something like:\n \n\t1. bower install --save mylibrary\n\t2. gulp bower\n\t\nBower libraries are copied to public/lib. For development, the files will be references from there. In production, they \nare concatenated into all.js and site.min.css.\n\nOnce installed, you have to tell require how to find the library. The paths and shims are located in the\n ./common/require-config.js file. If the library is require/amd aware, then you only need to tell require \n about the path. If not, then add a shim and tell require what it's main \"export\" is. \n\nThe production build process uses the amd hierarchy to decide what scripts, and in what order to include in the\nproduction all.js file. If your script it setup properly in require-config.js it should make its way to all.js\nand into production without any additional work.\n\nCurrently, most CSS is being included, inline, in site.less. If you want to include a css file on a single page only\nyou will have to add it (and any of its dependencies) to the gulpfile.js package task (package-copy-tmp).\n \n \nADDING A SERVER SIDE LIBRARY\n============================\nnpm install --save[-dev] mylibrary\n\n \nDEPLOYMENT\n====\nKaizen deployment consists of a packaged tar.gz file that contains all required dependencies to run the application in a\nproduction environment. \n\nrunning: \n\tgulp package\nwill create the tar.gz in the ./dist directory. \nGulp package does the following:\n\n\t1. Runs bower\n\t2. creates ./common/build.json containing build versioning information\n\t2. minifies and concatenates ALL javascript files and libraries according to the require.js dependencies, and creates an ./public/js/all.js\n\t3. copies required application files to the ./tmp_package directory. See gulp task \"package-copy-tmp\" for the files it copies.\n\t4. runs npm install --production to get the node libraries we need for production\n\t5. creates tar.gz of tmp_package directory\nThis file can be copied to any server of the same platform (OS X, Windows, Linux) it was built on and executed in place. \nRunning the application in production requires 4 environment variables:\n\n\t1. MONGO_URL=mongodb://username:password@1.2.3.4/kaizen\n\t2. NODE_ENV=production\n\t3. APP_BASE_URL=http://test.kaizen.surgeforward.com\n\t4. PORT=3000\n\nWhen deploying the application on linux, it's nice to have a daemon monitor and an init.d script. \nI use the npm packages: forever and initd-forever to accomplish this.\n\n\t1. npm install forever -g\n\t2. initd-forever --app /home/kaizen/app/kaizen/keystone.js --env production --name kaizen\n\t3. I then edited the generated script: vi /etc/init.d/kaizen \n\t   And added a second env variable below the line: export NODE_ENV=production \n\t   \n\t   MONGO_URL=mongodb://kaizen:*********@localhost/kaizen\n\t\n \t   \nFrom there I just run: \n\n\tservice kaizen [start|stop|restart|status] \nto manage the process. The init.d script uses\nforever to monitor the app and restart it if it crashes.\n\nOnce the init.d script is in place, upgarding is simply overwriting the contents of /home/kaizen/app/kaizen with a new tar.gz distribution. \n\t\n\n","stars":0,"contributors_list":[{"username":"mnelson","avatar_url":null,"user_type":"Anonymous","profile_url":null},{"username":"Josh Anderson","avatar_url":null,"user_type":"Anonymous","profile_url":null},{"username":"glosser-courtney","avatar_url":"https://avatars.github.boozallencsn.com/u/226?","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.boozallencsn.com/glosser-courtney"},{"username":"Akhtar-Ayyaz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.github.boozallencsn.com/u/125?","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.boozallencsn.com/Akhtar-Ayyaz"},{"username":"Chris Allnutt","avatar_url":null,"user_type":"Anonymous","profile_url":null},{"username":"Chris Allnutt","avatar_url":null,"user_type":"Anonymous","profile_url":null},{"username":"asaf-david","avatar_url":"https://avatars.github.boozallencsn.com/u/131?","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.boozallencsn.com/asaf-david"},{"username":"Burak-Ryan","avatar_url":"https://avatars.github.boozallencsn.com/u/89?","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.boozallencsn.com/Burak-Ryan"},{"username":"norman-allen","avatar_url":"https://avatars.github.boozallencsn.com/u/231?","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.boozallencsn.com/norman-allen"},{"username":"Smiley","avatar_url":null,"user_type":"Anonymous","profile_url":null},{"username":"kahn-eliezer","avatar_url":"https://avatars.github.boozallencsn.com/u/233?","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.boozallencsn.com/kahn-eliezer"},{"username":"Kohles-Jason","avatar_url":"https://avatars.github.boozallencsn.com/u/33?","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.boozallencsn.com/Kohles-Jason"},{"username":"napolitano-john","avatar_url":"https://avatars.github.boozallencsn.com/u/230?","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.boozallencsn.com/napolitano-john"},{"username":"Mike Nelson","avatar_url":null,"user_type":"Anonymous","profile_url":null},{"username":"Karnam-Raghavendra","avatar_url":"https://avatars.github.boozallencsn.com/u/109?","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.boozallencsn.com/Karnam-Raghavendra"},{"username":"kraemer","avatar_url":null,"user_type":"Anonymous","profile_url":null},{"username":"Mustafa AbuDarsh","avatar_url":null,"user_type":"Anonymous","profile_url":null},{"username":"EC2 Default User","avatar_url":null,"user_type":"Anonymous","profile_url":null}],"forks":0,"organization_url":"https://github.boozallencsn.com/PRED-INTEL-ACCT-GROUP","project_name":"CyberSimMEAN","org_avatar_url":"https://avatars.github.boozallencsn.com/u/192?","repository":"CyberSimMEAN","commits":1176,"readme_url":"https://raw.github.boozallencsn.com/PRED-INTEL-ACCT-GROUP/CyberSimMEAN/afcea_august_2016/README.md?token=AAAA21rB1HDDbrZhTigs7u_EwHCJDprkks5X_4xbwA%3D%3D","watchers":8,"language":"JavaScript","org_type":"Organization","organization":"PRED-INTEL-ACCT-GROUP"}

If this\napache instance is handling SSL this must match the subject name of\nthe SSL certificate.\n\n## cookiedomain ##\n\nThe domain to use for authentication cookies.  Needs to start with a period,\nor be the fully-qualified hostname.  Defaults to `.$domain`.\n\n## cookiename ##\n\nThe name of the authentication cookie.  Defaults to `opentoken`, needs to\nmatch the cookiename in your agent config.\n\n## filter ##\n\nA filter setting to allow you to do SSO only on a portion of the site.\nDefaults to `/` to protect everything (see `anonymous` if you want to\nallow certain areas to be accessed without authentication, such as for\nAPI endpoints).\n\n## idpid ##\n\nThis is your Identity Provider ID, it must match the value in your\nagent config.\n\n## loginhost ##\n\nThe hostname of the PingFederate server to redirect to for\nauthentication.  Defaults to `sso.boozallencsn.com`, for development\nhosts you might need to use `sso-dev.boozallencsn.com` instead.\n\n## loginurl ##\n\nThis url is assembled from the `loginhost` and `idpid` values, you\nshouldn't ever need to change it.\n\n## errorurl ##\n\nOptional.  Sets the URL to redirect to on errors.  Default is\nundefined (which will show the default PingFederate error page\ninstead).\n\n## cancelurl ##\n\nOptional.  Sets the URL to redirect to when authentication is\ncancelled.  Default is undefined (which will show the default\nPingFederate cancel page instead).\n\n## slourl ##\n\nOptional.  Sets the URL to redirect to when using Single Log Out.\nDefault is undefined (which disables Single Log Out).\n\n## pfbaseurl ##\n\nOptiona. Sets 'PingFederateBaseUrl' in the Apache configuration.\nDefaults to undefined to use the PingFederate defaults.  You shouldn't\never need to set this.\n\n## testmode ##\n\nEnables testmode, which allows you to append ?cmd=PingStartPage to any\nURL on your server and get back a test page showing the PingFederate\nvalues that were passed to the server.  Default is `false` to disable\nthis option.\n\n## loglevel ##\n\nSet the log level for PingFederate logging.  The default level is\n`warning`.\n\n## ssl_crl, ssl_crl_path, ssl_crl_check, ssl_crl_chain ##\n\nSSL CRL settings, you shouldn't need these in most cases.\n\n## ssl_ca ##\n\nThe path to your SSL CA certificate.  Default is /etc/pki/tls/cert.pem.\n\n## ssl_cert ##\n\nThe path to your ssl certificate.  Default is\n`/etc/pki/tls/certs/$servername.pem`.\n\n## ssl_key ##\n\nThe path to your ssl key.  Default is\n`/etc/pki/tls/private/$servername.pem`.\n\n## agentconfig ##\n\nThe path to the pingfederate agent-config file.  The CSN\nInfrastructure team will provide you with this file when your SSO\ninstance is configured, you just have to put it wherever this option\nsays it can be found.  Default is `/etc/httpd/conf/agent-config.txt`.\n\n## backend_port ##\n\nThe port that the application itself actually listens on.  Default is `3000`.\n\n## redirect_port ##\n\nIf set then an apache instance will be configured on this port that just\nredirects you to the https port.  Default is `80`.\n\n## https_port ##\n\nIf set then an apache listener configured for SSL will be run on this port\ndefault is 443.\n\n## http_port ##\n\nIf set then an apache listener configured for http will be run on this\nport.  This defaults to undefined, to disable an http listener.  You\nSHOULD NOT use this except in very specific circumstances.  This is\nprimarily intended for SSL offload.  If you are doing SSL offload you\nshould set this to an HTTP port that the offload device (such as\na NetScaler) can use, but you should also restrict access so that only\nthat offload device can hit this port.\n\n## verbosity ##\n\nSet the verbosity of logging.  Defaults to `2`.\n\n## authnprefix ##\n\nThis sets the prefix that is added to the headers that PingFederate\nuses to pass information to the application.  Default value is\n`PF_AUTH_`, which results in the username being in a header named\n`PF_AUTH_subject` in the request that is sent by Apache to the\napplication.  Any other values you requested to be sent from LDAP to\nPingFederate will also be sent to your application this way.\n\n## anonymous ##\n\nAn array of strings of URL prefixes that should not be protected by\nPingFederate.  This is normally used for informational pages that\ndon't require login or for things like API endpoints that have their\nown authentication methods.  These strings will be used in Apache\n<Location> blocks, so it basically has to be directory strings.\n\n## ssloffload ##\n\nSetting this to true will enable ssloffload support.  This is\nnecessary when doing SSL offload to prevent PingFederate from\nattempting to redirect browsers to the `http_port`.\n\nSetting this to true sets PingFederateApplicationScheme to https, and\nsets PingFederateApplicationPort to https_port.\n\n# Backend Configuration #\n\nThe app that you are forwarding requests to needs to be able to use\nthe proxy headers to authenticate the user.  These headers start with\n'PF_AUTH' (unless you have changed the `$authnprefix` setting), the\nusername will be in `PF_AUTH_subject`\n\nIf your application is running under Apache, you can use something\nlike this to set the REMOTE_USER environment variable.\n\n    RewriteCond %{HTTP:pf_auth_subject} ^(.*)$\n    RewriteRule .* - [E=REMOTE_USER:%1]\n","stars":0,"contributors_list":[{"username":"Kohles-Jason","avatar_url":"https://avatars.github.boozallencsn.com/u/33?","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.boozallencsn.com/Kohles-Jason"},{"username":"Puppet Forge","avatar_url":null,"user_type":"Anonymous","profile_url":null},{"username":"Kraemer-David","avatar_url":"https://avatars.github.boozallencsn.com/u/34?","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.boozallencsn.com/Kraemer-David"}],"forks":0,"organization_url":"https://github.boozallencsn.com/DevOps","project_name":"puppet-module-pf_proxy","org_avatar_url":"https://avatars.github.boozallencsn.com/u/300?","repository":"puppet-module-pf_proxy","commits":208,"readme_url":"https://raw.github.boozallencsn.com/DevOps/puppet-module-pf_proxy/master/README.md?token=AAAA2zMaD1XSK0YkmUT0fWXjWszN-2QTks5X_4xewA%3D%3D","watchers":2,"language":"Puppet","org_type":"Organization","organization":"DevOps"}

[Development - Guide for contributing to the module](#development)\n\n## Description\n\nStart with a one- or two-sentence summary of what the module does and/or what\nproblem it solves. This is your 30-second elevator pitch for your module.\nConsider including OS/Puppet version it works with.\n\nYou can give more descriptive information in a second paragraph. This paragraph\nshould answer the questions: \"What does this module *do*?\" and \"Why would I use\nit?\" If your module has a range of functionality (installation, configuration,\nmanagement, etc.), this is the time to mention it.\n\n## Setup\n\n### What epo_agent affects **OPTIONAL**\n\nIf it's obvious what your module touches, you can skip this section. For\nexample, folks can probably figure out that your mysql_instance module affects\ntheir MySQL instances.\n\nIf there's more that they should know about, though, this is the place to mention:\n\n* A list of files, packages, services, or operations that the module will alter,\n  impact, or execute.\n* Dependencies that your module automatically installs.\n* Warnings or other important notices.\n\n### Setup Requirements **OPTIONAL**\n\nIf your module requires anything extra before setting up (pluginsync enabled,\netc.), mention it here.\n\nIf your most recent release breaks compatibility or requires particular steps\nfor upgrading, you might want to include an additional \"Upgrading\" section\nhere.\n\n### Beginning with epo_agent\n\nThe very basic steps needed for a user to get the module up and running. This\ncan include setup steps, if necessary, or it can be an example of the most\nbasic use of the module.\n\n## Usage\n\nThis section is where you describe how to customize, configure, and do the\nfancy stuff with your module here. It's especially helpful if you include usage\nexamples and code samples for doing things with your module.\n\n## Reference\n\nHere, include a complete list of your module's classes, types, providers,\nfacts, along with the parameters for each. Users refer to this section (thus\nthe name \"Reference\") to find specific details; most users don't read it per\nse.\n\n## Limitations\n\nThis is where you list OS compatibility, version compatibility, etc. If there\nare Known Issues, you might want to include them under their own heading here.\n\n## Development\n\nSince your module is awesome, other users will want to play with it. Let them\nknow what the ground rules for contributing are.\n\n## Release Notes/Contributors/Etc. **Optional**\n\nIf you aren't using changelog, put your release notes here (though you should\nconsider using changelog). You can also add any additional sections you feel\nare necessary or important to include here. Please use the `## ` header.\n","stars":0,"contributors_list":[{"username":"krajewski-frank","avatar_url":"https://avatars.github.boozallencsn.com/u/394?","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.boozallencsn.com/krajewski-frank"},{"username":"Kohles-Jason","avatar_url":"https://avatars.github.boozallencsn.com/u/33?","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.boozallencsn.com/Kohles-Jason"}],"forks":0,"organization_url":"https://github.boozallencsn.com/DevOps","project_name":"puppet-module-epo_agent","org_avatar_url":"https://avatars.github.boozallencsn.com/u/300?","repository":"puppet-module-epo_agent","commits":13,"readme_url":"https://raw.github.boozallencsn.com/DevOps/puppet-module-epo_agent/master/README.md?token=AAAA2y7SV0NfZQxB628ASRQy02Kfp24jks5X_4xfwA%3D%3D","watchers":3,"language":"Puppet","org_type":"Organization","organization":"DevOps"}

This is what we use in the SSP project to get API keys,\npasswords and other sensitive information out of Vault.\n\n## Development Setup ##\n\nTo use this in a development environment, you have two options.  You\ncan either run a development instance of Vault, or you can fake it by\nputting your secret information into a file and just letting the\nsecrets module read that.\n\n*IMPORTANT*: NEVER check secret information into your code repositories!\n\n### Fake (file) mode ###\n\nIn fake mode you can provide a file (.js, .json, .yml or .yaml) that\ncontains your secrets.  This mode should only be used for development,\nas it's much less secure, and also because the file is loaded every\ntime you request a secret (in case the file has changed) and it is\nloaded synchronously (even though it still returns a promise).\n\nTo enable fake mode, set `$SECRETS_FILE` to the path to your file:\n\n  export SECRETS_FILE=./secrets.yaml\n\nThe data structure in this mode is very simple, it should just return\nan object where the keys are paths that the program could request, and\nthe values are objects containing the secrets for that key.\n\nFor example, using fake information from the ldap-workers package:\n\n    ---\n    ldap/bah:\n      binddn: bind_username\n      password: notReallyAPassword!!\n\n### Vault Connection ###\n\nTo setup a local development instance of Vault, first install Vault by\ndownloading a package from https://www.vaultproject.io/downloads.html\nor from homebrew:\n\n    $ brew install vault\n\nIn another terminal start vault in dev mode:\n\n    $ vault server --dev\n\nIn your main terminal export a non-https VAULT_ADDR:\n\n    $ export VAULT_ADDR='http://127.0.0.1:8200'\n\nYou don't actually need to export this for your application to work, but if you\ndon't include this and you try to use the Vault CLI it will fail, since it\ndefaults to https.\n\n### Insert some secrets into vault ###\n\nNow you can insert some secrets into Vault.  If you don't know how to do this,\nsee https://www.vaultproject.io/intro/getting-started/first-secret.html\n\n## Development Usage ##\n\nUsing this module is very simple, it just exports a single function, which you\ncall with the path to the secret data that you need to retrieve.  It will\nreturn a promise that resolves to the data you requested.\n\nHere is an example of how to check a password against a password\nstored in Vault:\n\n    #!/usr/bin/env node\n    'use strict';\n    const Secrets = require( 'secrets' );\n\n    const input = 'checkThisPasswordOutYo!';\n    Secrets( 'secret/devel/check_secret' ).then( check_secret => {\n      if ( input === check_secret ) {\n        console.log( 'input matched stored secret' );\n      } else {\n        console.log( 'input did not match stored secret' );\n      }\n    } );\n\n# Configuration #\n\nThere are three ways you can pass configuration to secrets:\n\n## Environment Variables ##\n\nSome values can be passed as environment variables:\n\n    $ export VAULT_ADDR='http://vault:8200'\n    $ export VAULT_TOKEN='xxx-token-xxx'\n\n## Default Configuration ##\n\nYou can set values as defaults by calling secrets.config( config ).  This\nwill add whatever values you include to the default configuration.  For\noptions that can also be set from an environment variable or a file if they\nare undefined in the defaults you pass in then the environment variable or\nfile will be used.\n\n## Configuration Options ##\n\n| config key | environment variable | default                         |\n| ---------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------- |\n| endpoint   | VAULT_ADDR           | http://localhost:8200/          |\n| token      | VAULT_TOKEN          | contents of ~/.vault-token file |\n| file       | SECRETS_FILE         | null                            |\n| prefix     | SECRETS_PREFIX       | null                            |\n\n# Prefixing #\n\nSometimes you have a tool that access a lot of different secrets under\nthe same prefix (for example, all the secrets for SSP Workers are\nstored under `secret/ssp/workers`).  In this case you can provide a prefix\nthat will be automatically appended when you call the function.\n","stars":0,"contributors_list":[{"username":"Kohles-Jason","avatar_url":"https://avatars.github.boozallencsn.com/u/33?","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.boozallencsn.com/Kohles-Jason"}],"forks":0,"organization_url":"https://github.boozallencsn.com/SelfServicePortal","project_name":"node-secrets","org_avatar_url":"https://avatars.github.boozallencsn.com/u/459?","repository":"node-secrets","commits":3,"readme_url":"https://raw.github.boozallencsn.com/SelfServicePortal/node-secrets/master/README.md?token=AAAA2x1GS7LcTYA16nW0O9AxoIAoZYIoks5X_4xuwA%3D%3D","watchers":1,"language":"JavaScript","org_type":"Organization","organization":"SelfServicePortal"}

Many of the functions performed by these tools\nassume you have flat directory structure.  I used `~/ssp-dev`, but you\ncan use whatever directory you want.  Once you have that directory,\nclone this repo there.\n\n    mkdir ~/ssp-dev\n    cd ~/ssp-dev\n    git clone git@github.boozallencsn.com:SelfServicePortal/ssp-devtool.git\n\nThen run `./bin/devtool init` and put the output from that into\nyour shell's configuration file.\n\n    ./bin/ssp-devtool >> ~/.bash_profile\n\n# Usage #\n\nTo see what options are available, run devtool with no arguments.\n\nHere are some of the most important commands:\n\n## devtool help ##\n\nShow the help information, which includes a list of all the commands\nyou can run.\n\nUse `devtool help <command>` to see what options are available for the\ntop-level commands.\n\n## devtool package setup ##\n\nConfigures a package repository.  This command attempts to determine\nif your repo is a node package then it adds some standard boilerplate\nto files in the repository.\n\nAmong the things it configures are:\n\n  * Standard test suite (mocha, chai, sinon, etc)\n  * Configures eslint\n  * If it detects babel is in use:\n    * Sets up standard babel configuration\n  * If the package name starts with `@components`:\n    * Sets up standard SSP component configurations\n  * If the package name starts with `@workers`:\n    * Sets up standard SSP worker configurations\n\nMake sure that any files you care about have been committed (or at\nleast added) to git before you run this command!  That way if you\ndon't like the changes it makes you can roll them back.\n\nIf you want to start using something it doesn't detect, you can include\na --add argument to specify the flag you want to set.  For example, if\nyou want to start using react in that package, but haven't used it before\nso it doesn't get auto-detected, you can run:\n\n    devtool package setup --add react\n\n## devtool package check ##\n\nChecks for some common problems in node packages.\n\n## devtool workstation setup ##\n\nSetup your local workstation.  Makes sure you have all the things\ninstalled that you need installed.  Many of the other devtool commands\nwon't work until you have done this.\n\nCurrently this installs [Homebrew](http://brew.sh), then uses Homebrew\nto install:\n\n  * [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org)\n  * [git](http://git-scm.com)\n  * [gitflow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow)\n  * [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/)\n\n## devtool workstation update ##\n\nUpdates a bunch of stuff, including homebrew packages.  Also runs\n`brew cleanup`.\n\n## devtool workstation check ##\n\nChecks some commands that might be missing and runs `brew doctor`.\n\n","stars":0,"contributors_list":[{"username":"Kohles-Jason","avatar_url":"https://avatars.github.boozallencsn.com/u/33?","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.boozallencsn.com/Kohles-Jason"}],"forks":0,"organization_url":"https://github.boozallencsn.com/SelfServicePortal","project_name":"ssp-devtool","org_avatar_url":"https://avatars.github.boozallencsn.com/u/459?","repository":"ssp-devtool","commits":1,"readme_url":"https://raw.github.boozallencsn.com/SelfServicePortal/ssp-devtool/master/README.md?token=AAAA2-aA5kOkp1TXGSuzgUJoni8z1oAaks5X_4x-wA%3D%3D","watchers":1,"language":"JavaScript","org_type":"Organization","organization":"SelfServicePortal"}

[Development - Guide for contributing to the module](#development)\n\n## Description\n\nStart with a one- or two-sentence summary of what the module does and/or what\nproblem it solves. This is your 30-second elevator pitch for your module.\nConsider including OS/Puppet version it works with.\n\nYou can give more descriptive information in a second paragraph. This paragraph\nshould answer the questions: \"What does this module *do*?\" and \"Why would I use\nit?\" If your module has a range of functionality (installation, configuration,\nmanagement, etc.), this is the time to mention it.\n\n## Setup\n\n### What nitro affects **OPTIONAL**\n\nIf it's obvious what your module touches, you can skip this section. For\nexample, folks can probably figure out that your mysql_instance module affects\ntheir MySQL instances.\n\nIf there's more that they should know about, though, this is the place to mention:\n\n* A list of files, packages, services, or operations that the module will alter,\n  impact, or execute.\n* Dependencies that your module automatically installs.\n* Warnings or other important notices.\n\n### Setup Requirements **OPTIONAL**\n\nIf your module requires anything extra before setting up (pluginsync enabled,\netc.), mention it here.\n\nIf your most recent release breaks compatibility or requires particular steps\nfor upgrading, you might want to include an additional \"Upgrading\" section\nhere.\n\n### Beginning with nitro\n\nThe very basic steps needed for a user to get the module up and running. This\ncan include setup steps, if necessary, or it can be an example of the most\nbasic use of the module.\n\n## Usage\n\nThis section is where you describe how to customize, configure, and do the\nfancy stuff with your module here. It's especially helpful if you include usage\nexamples and code samples for doing things with your module.\n\n## Reference\n\nHere, include a complete list of your module's classes, types, providers,\nfacts, along with the parameters for each. Users refer to this section (thus\nthe name \"Reference\") to find specific details; most users don't read it per\nse.\n\n## Limitations\n\nThis is where you list OS compatibility, version compatibility, etc. If there\nare Known Issues, you might want to include them under their own heading here.\n\n## Development\n\nSince your module is awesome, other users will want to play with it. Let them\nknow what the ground rules for contributing are.\n\n## Release Notes/Contributors/Etc. **Optional**\n\nIf you aren't using changelog, put your release notes here (though you should\nconsider using changelog). You can also add any additional sections you feel\nare necessary or important to include here. Please use the `## ` header.\n","stars":0,"contributors_list":[{"username":"feaga-joseph","avatar_url":"https://avatars.github.boozallencsn.com/u/493?","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.boozallencsn.com/feaga-joseph"}],"forks":0,"organization_url":"https://github.boozallencsn.com/feaga-joseph","project_name":"puppet-module-nitro_agent","org_avatar_url":"https://avatars.github.boozallencsn.com/u/493?","repository":"puppet-module-nitro_agent","commits":1,"readme_url":"https://raw.github.boozallencsn.com/feaga-joseph/puppet-module-nitro_agent/master/README.md?token=AAAA29JON0TCspgsc4q_sLIWIt9fV7Qvks5X_4zqwA%3D%3D","watchers":1,"language":"Puppet","org_type":"User","organization":"feaga-joseph"}

Ensure that [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) is installed. This provides the platform on which the build tooling runs.\n2. From the project folder, execute the following command:\n\n  ```shell\n  npm install\n  ```\n3. Ensure that [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) is installed globally. If you need to install it, use the following command:\n\n  ```shell\n  npm install -g gulp\n  ```\n  > **Note:** Gulp must be installed globally, but a local version will also be installed to ensure a compatible version is used for the project.\n4. Ensure that [jspm](http://jspm.io/) is installed globally. If you need to install it, use the following command:\n\n  ```shell\n  npm install -g jspm\n  ```\n  > **Note:** jspm must be installed globally, but a local version will also be installed to ensure a compatible version is used for the project.\n\n  > **Note:** jspm queries GitHub to install semver packages, but GitHub has a rate limit on anonymous API requests. It is advised that you configure jspm with your GitHub credentials in order to avoid problems. You can do this by executing `jspm registry config github` and following the prompts. If you choose to authorize jspm by an access token instead of giving your password (see GitHub `Settings > Personal Access Tokens`), `public_repo` access for the token is required.\n5. Install the client-side dependencies with jspm:\n\n  ```shell\n  jspm install -y\n  ```\n  >**Note:** Windows users, if you experience an error of \"unknown command unzip\" you can solve this problem by doing `npm install -g unzip` and then re-running `jspm install`.\n6. To run the app, execute the following command:\n\n  ```shell\n  gulp watch\n  ```\n7. Browse to [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000) to see the app. You can make changes in the code found under `src` and the browser should auto-refresh itself as you save files.\n\n> The Skeleton App uses [BrowserSync](http://www.browsersync.io/) for automated page refreshes on code/markup changes concurrently across multiple browsers. If you prefer to disable the mirroring feature set the [ghostMode option](http://www.browsersync.io/docs/options/#option-ghostMode) to false\n\n## Running The App under Electron\n\n#### Note:\nThe first five steps below are identical to the first five steps for running this app the \"standard' way, using the jspm / systemjs tooling. The difference is in the command to run the app, where the standard `gulp watch` command is replaced by the sequence of two commands:\n\n```shell\ngulp build\nelectron index.js\n```\n\nTo run the app under [Electron](http://electron.atom.io), follow these steps.\n\n1. Install [Electron](http://electron.atom.io)\n\n  ```shell\n  npm install electron-prebuilt -g\n```\n\n2. From the project folder, execute the following command:\n\n  ```shell\n  npm install\n  ```\n\n3. Ensure that [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) is installed globally. If you need to install it, use the following command:\n\n  ```shell\n  npm install -g gulp\n  ```\n  > **Note:** Gulp must be installed globally, but a local version will also be installed to ensure a compatible version is used for the project.\n\n4. Ensure that [jspm](http://jspm.io/) is installed globally. If you need to install it, use the following command:\n\n  ```shell\n  npm install -g jspm\n  ```\n  > **Note:** jspm must be installed globally, but a local version will also be installed to ensure a compatible version is used for the project.\n\n  > **Note:** jspm queries GitHub to install semver packages, but GitHub has a rate limit on anonymous API requests. It is advised that you configure jspm with your GitHub credentials in order to avoid problems. You can do this by executing `jspm registry config github` and following the prompts. If you choose to authorize jspm by an access token instead of giving your password (see GitHub `Settings > Personal Access Tokens`), `public_repo` access for the token is required.\n\n5. Install the client-side dependencies with jspm:\n\n  ```shell\n  jspm install -y\n  ```\n  >**Note:** Windows users, if you experience an error of \"unknown command unzip\" you can solve this problem by doing `npm install -g unzip` and then re-running `jspm install`.\n\n6. To build the app execute the following command (this will give you a dist directory)\n\n ```shell\n    gulp build\n ```\n\n7. To start the app, execute the following command:\n\n  ```shell\n  electron index.js\n  ```\n>**Note:** If typing the command `electron index.js` is too much for you change this line in package.json from `\"main\": \"dist/main.js\",` to `\"main\": \"index.js\",`\n> Then, you can invoke electron by just typing\n ```shell\n   electron .\n```\n\n\n## Bundling\nBundling is performed by [Aurelia Bundler](http://github.com/aurelia/bundler). A gulp task is already configured for that. Use the following command to bundle the app:\n\n  ```shell\n    gulp bundle\n  ```\n\nYou can also unbundle using the command bellow:\n\n  ```shell\n    gulp unbundle\n  ```\n\nTo start the bundled app, execute the following command:\n\n  ```shell\n    gulp serve-bundle\n  ```\n#### Configuration\nThe configuration is done by ```bundles.js``` file.\n##### Optional\nUnder ```options``` of ```dist/aurelia``` add ```rev: true``` to add bundle file revision/version.\n\n## Running The Unit Tests\n\nTo run the unit tests, first ensure that you have followed the steps above in order to install all dependencies and successfully build the library. Once you have done that, proceed with these additional steps:\n\n1. Ensure that the [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/) CLI is installed. If you need to install it, use the following command:\n\n  ```shell\n  npm install -g karma-cli\n  ```\n2. Install Aurelia libs for test visibility:\n\n  ```shell\n  jspm install aurelia-framework\n  jspm install aurelia-http-client\n  jspm install aurelia-router\n  ```\n3. You can now run the tests with this command:\n\n  ```shell\n  karma start\n  ```\n\n## Running The E2E Tests\nIntegration tests are performed with [Protractor](http://angular.github.io/protractor/#/).\n\n1. Place your E2E-Tests into the folder ```test/e2e/src```\n2. Install the necessary webdriver\n\n  ```shell\n  gulp webdriver-update\n  ```\n\n3. Configure the path to the webdriver by opening the file ```protractor.conf.js``` and adjusting the ```seleniumServerJar``` property. Typically its only needed to adjust the version number.\n\n4. Make sure your app runs and is accessible\n\n  ```shell\n  gulp watch\n  ```\n\n5. In another console run the E2E-Tests\n\n  ```shell\n  gulp e2e\n  ```\n\n## Exporting bundled production version\nA gulp task is already configured for that. Use the following command to export the app:\n\n  ```shell\n    gulp export\n  ```\nThe app will be exported into ```export``` directory preserving the directory structure.\n#### Configuration\nThe configuration is done by ```bundles.js``` file.\nIn addition, ```export.js``` file is available for including individual files.\n","stars":1,"contributors_list":[{"username":"herrjosua","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1341786?v=3","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.com/herrjosua"},{"username":"camelspeed","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1281035?v=3","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.com/camelspeed"},{"username":"onetrickwolf","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13836477?v=3","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.com/onetrickwolf"},{"username":"natesol-code21","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2308028?v=3","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.com/natesol-code21"},{"username":"Joshua Bock","avatar_url":null,"user_type":"Anonymous","profile_url":null},{"username":"Joshua Bock","avatar_url":null,"user_type":"Anonymous","profile_url":null}],"forks":0,"organization_url":"https://github.com/Project-Heimdall","project_name":"heimdall-uiapp","org_avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18699526?v=3","repository":"heimdall-uiapp","commits":511,"readme_url":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Project-Heimdall/heimdall-uiapp/development/README.md","watchers":6,"language":"CSS","org_type":"Organization","organization":"Project-Heimdall"}

Alternatively, you're free to work using a local VirtualBox VM running Ubuntu (14.04 on our EC2s). You can get an Ubuntu .iso [here](http://www.ubuntu.com/download) and VirtualBox [here.](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)\n\n- To access your machine, use the certificate you received to SSH into the machine's public IP. A list will be emailed to your team.\n- Your DevOps solution may require your machines to talk to one another. Use each machine's private IP when referencing your team's other machines. To find your private IP, log into your machine and:\n```shell\nhostname\n```\nIf your hostname is ip-123-45-67-89, then your private IP is 123.45.67.89.\n\n### Example EC2 session:\n```shell\n# You may have to run \nchmod 0400 HackTeamX.pem \n# in terminal/GitBash first. You'll only need to do this once.\nssh -i HackTeamX.pem ubuntu@[public_ip]\n```\n\n## Duplicating Repo  \nYou will need [Git][git] to make a duplicate of this repository. \n\n\n- Make a bare clone of the repository  \n```\t\n\tgit clone --bare https://github.com/GridIron/hackathon\n```\n- Push to your new repository  \n\t- Must create repo on github first\n```\t\n\tcd hackathon.git  \n\tgit push --mirror https://github.com/your-username/your-new-repo\n```\n- Remove our temporary local repository  \n```\t\n\tcd ..  \n\trm -rf hackathon.git\n```\n- Now you can make a clone of your new repo  \n```\n\tgit clone https://github.com/your-username/your-new-repo\n```\n\n\n## Building the Front End\n\n- Install nodeJS, npm, get certificate key, and get rid of NodeJS linking confusion:\n```\n\tsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y npm nodejs\n\tgpg --keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3\n\tsudo ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node\n```\n\n- Install rvm \n\t- If you are running this locally, you'll need to switch to GuestWifi to get rvm\n\t- If you are using a VM, you will need to restart your VM after changing wifi\n```\n\t# You probably don't need rdoc and ri, so let's not...\n\techo 'gem: --no-rdoc --no-ri' >> ~/.gemrc\n\tcurl -sSL -k https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --rails\n\tsource /home/$USER/.rvm/scripts/rvm (command outputted from the previous command)\n```\n\t\n- Install ruby 2.2.2  \n```\n\trvm install ruby-2.2.2\n```\n\n- Check ruby version, and ensure version 2.2.2 is in use\n```\n\truby -v\n```\n\n- If anything other than 2.2.2 use, you can change it by running\n```\n\trvm use 2.2.2\n```\t\t\n\n\n- If getting the `rvm is not a function error`, follow the instructions [here][rvm]\n\n\n- Install and set up bower, grunt, dependencies, compass\n\t- Run this command to make git replace the protocol for you, this prevents trouble with git when installing dependencies (firewall issue).\n```\n\tgit config --global url.\"https://\".insteadOf git://\n```\nMove to the www directory `your-repo-name/www` and run the following:\n```\n\tsudo apt-get install -y ruby-dev\n\tsudo npm install -g bower grunt\n\n\tbower install\n\tbower install grunt-cli\n\t\n\t# npm install will take 5-10 minutes...go get coffee\n\tsudo npm install\n\tsudo npm install -g grunt-cli\n\tgem install compass\n```\n\n\t\n#### Run the front-end  \n- Run this from the www directory\n\t- If running ubuntu on EC2, a change will need to be made in Gruntfile.js. On line 84 change 'localhost' to '0.0.0.0', keeping the quotes\n```\n\tgrunt serve\t\n```\n\n- If grunt serve is not working (not hanging), and you recieve errors try the following\n```\n\tsudo rm -rf node_modules\n\tsudo npm install\n\tsudo gem install compass\n\tgrunt serve\n```\n- The webpage appears at `localhost:9000` or `your-public-ip:9000`\n\n\n## Building the Database and API\n```\n\tsudo apt-get install -y postgresql postgresql-contrib\n```\n\n- Modify the `database.yml` file located at `your-repo-name/api/config/database.yml` \n```\n  \tdevelopment: &default  \n  \tadapter: postgresql  \n  \tdatabase: ads_development  \n  \tencoding: utf8  \n  \thost: localhost  \n  \tmin_messages: warning  \n  \tpool: 2  \n  \ttimeout: 5000  \n  \tusername: postgres\t\t\t\t\t\t*add this line  \n  \tpassword:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t*add this line  \n```\n- Modify the `pg_hba.conf` file located at `/etc/postgresql/9.3/main/pg_hba.conf` to look like below\n\t- The contents you need to modify are located at/near the bottom of the file (Shift+G in vim...)\n\t- You **MUST** use sudo to view and edit the file contents\n```\n\t# Database administrative login by Unix domain socket\n\tlocal   all             postgres                                peer\n\n\t# TYPE  DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD\n\n\t# \"local\" is for Unix domain socket connections only\n\tlocal   all             all                                     trust\n\t# IPv4 local connections:\n\thost    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            trust\n\t# IPv6 local connections:\n\thost    all             all             ::1/128                 trust\n```\n- Refresh the file for postgres by using the psql terminal as postgres user  \n```\n\tsudo -u postgres psql\n\t\n\tselect pg_reload_conf();\n\t\\q\n```\n\n- Move to the api directory (your-repo-name/api) and run the following commands to install rake, bundler, rails, and more dependencies\n```\n\tsudo apt-get install -y rake libpq-dev\n\tgem install bundler\n\tsudo gem install rails\n\n* Make sure ruby version is 2.2.2 (may have switched during install) if not follow the instructions above\n\n\tbundle install\n```\n\n- Create and migrate the database  \n```\n  \trake db:create db:migrate  \n```\n\n- Run the api (from api directory)\n\t- If running ubuntu on EC2, use  `rails s -b 0.0.0.0 -p 3000` \n```\n\trails s\n```\t\t\n\n\n[git]: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git\n[rvm]: https://rvm.io/integration/gnome-terminal\n","stars":2,"contributors_list":[{"username":"davislhidc","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13124057?v=3","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.com/davislhidc"},{"username":"willkjackson","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1631162?v=3","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.com/willkjackson"},{"username":"mtrujBAH","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13352813?v=3","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.com/mtrujBAH"},{"username":"EC2 Default User","avatar_url":null,"user_type":"Anonymous","profile_url":null},{"username":"mandavav","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12261759?v=3","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.com/mandavav"}],"forks":1,"organization_url":"https://github.com/GridIron","project_name":"hackathon","org_avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13223078?v=3","repository":"hackathon","commits":53,"readme_url":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GridIron/hackathon/master/README.md","watchers":16,"language":"JavaScript","org_type":"Organization","organization":"GridIron"}

Install git\n2. Install the [Chef Development Kit](https://downloads.chef.io/chef-dk)\n  \n  The Chef Development Kit (Chef DK) gives you the tools needed to write Chef code from your workstation. Once you install ChefDK, make sure your [system ruby](https://docs.chef.io/install_dk.html#set-system-ruby) is set as the ruby included with ChefDK.\n  \n3. Install the knife-push plugin\n  \n  ```\n  chef gem install knife-push\n  ```\n  \n4. Install the [Delivery Command Line Interface](https://s3.amazonaws.com/delivery-packages/cli/delivery-cli-latest.dmg)\n  \n  You'll use the Delivery Command Line Interface (Delivery CLI) to interact with Chef Delivery. If your Mac won't allow you to install 3rd party applications, go to Preferences > Security > General and there should be an option to install anyway.\n  \n5. Update your Delivery user with an SSH public key\n  \n  Start by generating an SSH key, unless you already have an SSH public key that you can use, for example, ```~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub```.\n  \n  ```\n  ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C \"YOUR_EMAIL@bah.com\"\n  ```\n  \n  Copy the contents of your id_rsa.pub file. It should look similar to this:\n  \n  ```\n  ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAACAQDa8BR/9bj5lVUfQP9Rsqon5qJMkiVm+JAtGiwnhxqgyRhk\n  YLIzm6+gcifDgMOMuwZA88Ib5WNRhxjlmTseapower4rH/jAAczdp1h17xLEEbUfQfkcqiy/Drp3k1234567\n  8ad234fgvdsasdfasdfR9ddNIeNvQ7OIpOCfLEPCyFz3aRRuhpM/5cySFT7bl1O44bNgfiuqRzcXFscZb03W\n  PlhaPwCvL2uxaRzdrAGQmE5jzCo6nORvKoGdVDa2++def33f3xPZCo3oJ08Q9XJ2CnfJlmyNe1hwI2NOQ3yR\n  bcnfSMona7ccSyHRWGs5bS//u6P0NK5AqH5jK8pg3XwtHZqLwUVy1wX0WnnJWg9IWXf32g3P4O4NJGVUeX33\n  Czv32GK8YphuEweqFu/Ej7kQp1ppIxkEtrpBfMi3na0QqZlk6wwghZLa++DUfWOhGsuuBgnsocAR5rLGy+gk\n  ypdie1Ydoe8qjLVZR/jKybQfQjuZOS30fZnwJhl2ZaeraPfkEXlVhK02/8PIALGfeXdt9KvQN0p5c6lRoDxq\n  BqslM+1KbKKcGdlSGEsAIP9OOWBECRxlOwqlqGHtrgWKOr376dntMIy2+fFD/74tJMjRwbRzm8IGWmj6OcF6\n  EvTYYO4RmISD8G+6dm1m4MlxLS53aZQWgYWvRdfNB1DAZo3h9Q== YOUR_EMAIL@bah.com\n  ```\n  \n  Open your user profile (select Users from the drop-down menu on the upper right, then navigate to your profile) and paste the contents of your id_rsa.pub file into the large text area under Security Information that says Enter SSH Public Key, and save your profile.\n  \n6. Authenticate to Delivery's git server\n  \n  Run this command in your terminal, using your delivery username, the delivery enterprise, and the delivery server ip address. You can find the enterprise directly below your name in the top right corner.\n  \n  ```\n  ssh -l YOUR_USERNAME@ENTERPRISE -p 8989 SERVER_IP_ADDRESS\n  ```\n  \n  Your workstation should now be set up to start contributing.\n  \n### How to Contribute\n\n1. Clone the project to your local workstation\n  \n  Go to the project page (select Organizations from the drop-down menu on the upper right, then navigate to Development, then DevOpsPlaybook) and copy the ```delivery clone``` command on the upper right of the page. It should look similar to this:\n  \n  ```\n  delivery clone DevOpsPlaybook --ent=ENTERPRISE --org=ORGANIZATION --user=YOUR_USERNAME --server=SERVER_IP_ADDRESS\n  ```\n  \n  In your terminal, create a directory for the repo wherever you choose, then navigate to that directory and run the command.\n  \n2. Navigate to the project directory\n3. Checkout a feature branch\n  \n  Delivery relies on feature branches, meaning that you can not edit or submit changes for the master branch. To checkout a feature branch, run this command:\n  \n  ```\n  git checkout -b FEATURE_BRANCH_NAME\n  ```\n  \n4. Make your changes\n5. Add and commit your changes\n  \n  ```\n  git add -A\n  git commit -m \"Commit Message\"\n  ```\n  \n6. Submit your changes to delivery for review\n  \n  ```\n  delivery review\n  ```\n  \n  You can now watch the progress of your commit through the pipeline from the Dashboard on the Delivery server.\n\n7. Sync the Delivery master branch and your local master branch\n  \n  Once your changes are approved, sync your local master branch with the delivery master:\n  \n  ```\n  git checkout master\n  git pull delivery master\n  ```\n  \n  You can now repeat steps 1-7 for each new feature you want to develop.\n","stars":0,"contributors_list":[{"username":"rdpa","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4347937?v=3","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.com/rdpa"},{"username":"chef-delivery","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11063783?v=3","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.com/chef-delivery"},{"username":"Jack Linden","avatar_url":null,"user_type":"Anonymous","profile_url":null},{"username":"eoladipo","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14336711?v=3","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.com/eoladipo"},{"username":"eoladipo","avatar_url":null,"user_type":"Anonymous","profile_url":null}],"forks":0,"organization_url":"https://github.com/GridIron","project_name":"DevOpsPlaybook","org_avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13223078?v=3","repository":"DevOpsPlaybook","commits":360,"readme_url":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GridIron/DevOpsPlaybook/master/README.md?token=AUKqYQ6KFkOPAet_uf_gxG7w11EPTN5cks5X_40xwA%3D%3D","watchers":8,"language":"CSS","org_type":"Organization","organization":"GridIron"}

For complete instructions on running your own copy of the API and other DATA Act broker components, please refer to the [documentation in the DATA Act core responsitory](https://github.com/fedspendingtransparency/data-act-core/blob/master/doc/INSTALL.md \"DATA Act broker installation guide\").\n\n### Handlers\nThe `dataactbroker\\handlers` folder contains the logic to handle requests that are dispatched from the `loginRoutes.py`, `fileRoutes.py`, and 'userRoutes.py' files. Routes defined in these files may include the `@permissions_check` tag to the route definition. This tag adds a wrapper that checks if there exists a session for the current user and if the user is logged in, as well as checking the user's permissions to determine if the user has access to this route. If user is not logged in to the system or does not have access to the route, a 401 HTTP error will be returned. This tag is defined in `dataactbroker/permissions.py`. Cookies are used to keep track of sessions for the end user. Only a UUID is stored in the cookie.\n\n`accountHandler.py` contains the functions to check logins and to log users out.\n\n`fileHandler.py` contains functions for managing user file interaction. It creates all of the jobs that are part of the user submission and has query methods to get the status of a submission. In addition, this class creates downloadable links to error reports created by the DATA Act Validator.\n\nIn addition to these helper objects, the following sub classes also exist within the directory: `UserHandler`, `JobHandler`, `ErrorHandler`, and 'InterfaceHolder'. These classes extend the database connection objects that are located in the Core Repository. Extra query methods exist in these classes that are used exclusively by the Broker API.\n\n## DATA Act Broker Route Documentation\n\n### Status Codes\nIn general, status codes returned are as follows:\n\n* 200 if successful\n* 400 if the request is malformed\n* 401 if the username or password are incorrect, or the session has expired\n* 500 for server-side errors\n\n### GET \"/\"\nThis route confirms that the broker is running\n\nExample input:\n\nNone\n\nExample output:\n\n\"Broker is running\"\n\n### User Routes\n\n#### POST \"/v1/login/\"\nThis route checks the username and password against a credentials file.

If this isn't the case, the easiest way to get started is to install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/ \"GitHub desktop\"), available for Windows or Mac.\n* You're familiar with opening a terminal on your machine and using the command line as needed.\n\n### Install Prerequisites and Code\n\n1. If you're not already running Node.js, download and run the installer for your operating system. We recommend v4.x: [https://nodejs.org/en/](https://nodejs.org/en/ \"Node.js installer\").\n\n2. Use *npm* (Node's package manager, which is part of the Node.js install) to install the latest version of gulp. This is necessary for runing the babel version of the `gulpfile`):\n\n    ```bash\n        $ npm install gulp && npm install gulp -g\n    ```\n\n3. From the command line, clone the DATA Act web app repository from GitHub to your local machine:\n\n        $ git clone https://github.com/fedspendingtransparency/data-act-broker-web-app.git\n\n4. Switch to the alpha release version of the code. This is the latest stable release.\n\n        $ git checkout v0.1.0-alpha\n\n    **Note:** If you'd rather use the latest, work-in-progress features of the DATA Act broker, replace the above command with `git checkout staging`.\n\n5. Change to the `data-act-broker-web-app` directory that was created when you cloned the DATA Act web repository.\n\n6. Install the web application's package dependencies:\n\n        $ npm install\n\n\n### Create Configurations\n\nThe `data-act-broker-web-app` folder provides three sample `GlobalConstants` files:\n\n * `sampleGlobalConstants_dev.js`\n * `sampleGlobalConstants_local.js`\n * `sampleGlobalConstants_prod.js`.\n\nUse these sample files to create files named `GlobalConstants_dev.js`, `GlobalConstants_local.js`, and `GlobalConstants_prod.js` respectively.\n\nThe sample files require you to provide values for:\n\n* `API` is the base API URL for the server that is hosting the API. It should start with an `https://` or `http://` protocol and end with `/v1/`, including the trailing slash\n\n\t* Note: the `sampleGlobalConstants_local.js` already has this field configured for you.\n\n* `LOCAL_ROOT` is the URL from which you are serving the frontend (this can be left as an empty string for non-local usage).\n* `GA_TRACKING_ID` is the tracking ID for Google Analytics.\n* `BUCKET_NAME` is the name of the AWS S3 bucket where uploaded files will reside.\n* `AWS_REGION` is the name of the [AWS region](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html) where the S3 bucket is hosted.\n\nOther fields, such as `LOCAL` and `DEV` should be left based on their sample values.\n\n### Run gulp tasks:\n\nSeveral Gulp tasks are available to build the frontend web site for various use cases.\n\n#### Hosted Production\n\nIf you are building the web site for a hosted production environment, run:\n\n```bash\n\t$ gulp production\n```\nThis will build the frontend files to the `/public` directory, which you can then deploy on your host. In this mode, JavaScript files are minified, debugging tools are disabled, and the `GlobalConstants_prod.js` file is used as the GlobalConstants file.\n\n#### Local Production\n\nIf you are using the DATA Act Broker in a fully local environment and you are not a developer, run:\n\n```bash\n\t$ gulp\n```\nThis will build the frontend files to the `/public` directory and start a web server on port 3000. In this mode, JavaScript files are minified, debugging tools are disabled, and the `GlobalConstants_local.js` file is used as the GlobalConstants file.\n\nTo use the frontend, go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in a supported web browser.\n\n*Note:* Before running the gulp task, ensure that no other applications or services are using port 3000 on your computer.\n\n#### Hosted Development (Build-only)\n\nIf you are deploying the frontend to a hosted environment for development/testing purposes, use:\n\n```bash\n\t$ gulp buildDev\n```\nThis will build the frontend files to the `/public` directory, which you can then deploy on your host. In this mode, JavaScript files are uncompressed and sourcemapped, debugging tools are enabled, and the `GlobalConstants_dev.js` file is used as the GlobalConstants file.\n\n#### Local Development\n\nFinally, if you are a frontend developer, use:\n\n```bash\n\t$ gulp dev\n```\n\nThis will build the frontend files to the `/public` directory and also start a web server on port 3000. In this mode, JavaScript files are uncompressed and sourcemapped, debugging tools are enabled and the `GlobalConstants_dev.js` file is used as the GlobalConstants file. Additionally, SASS files in the `/src/_scss` and `/src/css` folders are watched, along with JS files in the `/src/js` folder, and these files are recompiled (and the browser automatically refreshed) whenever a change is detected.\n\n\n### Modifying global constants:\n\nIn the top level directory, you will find `GlobalConstants_prod.js`, `GlobalConstants_local.js`, and `GlobalConstant_dev.js` that you may use for any conditional, global constants, such as the API endpoint you'd like to point to in either given scenario.\n\n## Full DATA Act Broker Setup\n\nFor instructions on contributing to this project or installing the DATA Act broker backend, please refer to the [documentation in the DATA Act core responsitory](https://github.com/fedspendingtransparency/data-act-core/blob/master/doc/INSTALL.md \"DATA Act broker installation guide\").\n","stars":3,"contributors_list":[{"username":"kevinli-work","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3594363?v=3","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.com/kevinli-work"},{"username":"mab6bf","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4449046?v=3","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.com/mab6bf"},{"username":"kyle-fox","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/654722?v=3","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.com/kyle-fox"},{"username":"klrBAH","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13200616?v=3","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.com/klrBAH"},{"username":"dfrasier","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/256019?v=3","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.com/dfrasier"},{"username":"ejgullo","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19807146?v=3","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.com/ejgullo"},{"username":"lisaam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16667780?v=3","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.com/lisaam"},{"username":"578507","avatar_url":null,"user_type":"Anonymous","profile_url":null},{"username":"mtpress","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4643648?v=3","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.com/mtpress"},{"username":"kaitlin","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/75555?v=3","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.com/kaitlin"},{"username":"bsweger","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/540544?v=3","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.com/bsweger"},{"username":"cmc333333","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/326918?v=3","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.com/cmc333333"},{"username":"nmonga91","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16244012?v=3","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.com/nmonga91"},{"username":"bahfolkoff","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11528424?v=3","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.com/bahfolkoff"},{"username":"jworcestBAH","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11858333?v=3","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.com/jworcestBAH"}],"forks":2,"organization_url":"https://github.com/fedspendingtransparency","project_name":"data-act-broker-web-app","org_avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8397762?v=3","repository":"data-act-broker-web-app","commits":1318,"readme_url":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fedspendingtransparency/data-act-broker-web-app/dev/README.md","watchers":12,"language":"JavaScript","org_type":"Organization","organization":"fedspendingtransparency"}

However, the available routes are documented below.\n\n##### GET `/`\nThis is used to confirm that the validator is running\n\nExample input: None  \nExample output: `Validator is running`\n\n##### POST `/validate/`\nCalled to apply validation rules to a specified job ID.  Expects a JSON with key \"job_id\" specifying which job to validate.  Valid records will be written to the staging database, and errors will be listed in the error report and summarized in the error database.\n\nExample input: `{\"job_id\":3664}`  \nExample output: None (status 200 if successful)\n\n##### POST `/validate_threaded/`\nSame as validate route, but launches validation in a separate thread and immediately returns 200.  Success or failure of the validation should then be determined from the job tracker database.  \n\nExample input: `{\"job_id\":3664}`  \nExample output: None\n\n## Process Overview\nThe validation process begins with a call to one of the above routes from either the job manager or the broker API, specifying the job ID for the validation job.  First, the validator checks the job tracker to ensure that the job is of the correct type, and that all prerequisites are completed.\n\nThe file location on S3 is specified in the job tracker, and the validator streams the file record by record from S3.  The first row is the headers, which are checked against the file specification to ensure that all headers in the file are known fields and that no required fields are missing.\n\nEach record is checked against the set of rules for the fields present in the file.  If a record passes all rules, it goes into the staging database.  Otherwise, each failed rule goes into the error report, and a running sum is kept of error occurrences for each rule, which are written to the error database after all rows have been checked.  Finally, the job is marked as finished in the job tracker, the file is marked completed in the error database.\n\n## Available Validations\nThe available rule types are as follows:\n\n* Type checks - verifies that data fits the specified type\n* Equal / Not equal - checks that value is equal to a specified value, or not equal\n* Less than / Greater than - compares value against a specified reference point\n* Length - checks that value is no longer than specified length\n* Set membership - checks that value is one of an allowed set of values\n* Minimum length - checks that the field has at least the number of characters specified\n* Conditional requirement - checks that the field is populated if another specified rule passes\n\n## Class Descriptions\n\n### Validation Handlers\n\n* `ValidationError` - Enumeration of error types and related messages\n* `ValidationManager` - Outer level manager that runs the validations, checking all relevant rules against each record.\n* `Validator` - Checks all rules against a single record\n\n### Filestreaming\n\n* `CsvReader` - Streams CSV files from S3, returning one record at a time\n* `CsvWriter` - Streams error report up to S3, one record at a time\n* `SchemaLoader` - Reads a specification of fields and rules to be applied to specified file type.\n* `TASLoader` - Loads valid TAS combinations from CARS file\n\n### Interfaces\n\n* `ErrorInterface`, `JobTrackerInterface`, `StagingInterface`, `ValidationInterface` - These classes control communication with their respective databases\n* `StagingTable` - Used to create a new table for each job and manage writes to that table\n* `InterfaceHolder` - Container that holds one interface for each database as a static variable to ensure that redundant connections are not created\n\n### Models\n* `validationModels` - Holds all the ORM objects for the validation database\n\n### Scripts\n\nThe `/dataactvalidator/scripts` folder contains the install scripts needed to setup the validator for a local install. For complete instructions on running your own copy of the validator and other DATA Act broker components, please refer to the [documentation in the DATA Act core responsitory](https://github.com/fedspendingtransparency/data-act-core/blob/master/doc/INSTALL.md \"DATA Act broker installation guide\").\n\n## Test Cases\nTo run the validator unit tests, navigate to the main project's test folder (`data-act-validator/tests`) and type the following:\n\n        $ python runTests.py\n\nTo generate a test coverage report from the command line:\n\n1. Make sure you're in the tests folder (`data-act-validator/tests`).\n2. Run the tests using the `coverage` command: `coverage run runTests.py`.\n3. After the tests are done running, view the coverage report by typing `coverage report`. To exclude third-party libraries from the report, you can tell it to ignore the `site-packages` folder: `coverage report --omit=*/site-packages*`.\n","stars":3,"contributors_list":[{"username":"jworcestBAH","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11858333?v=3","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.com/jworcestBAH"},{"username":"bsweger","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/540544?v=3","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.com/bsweger"},{"username":"mtpress","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4643648?v=3","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.com/mtpress"},{"username":"klrBAH","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13200616?v=3","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.com/klrBAH"},{"username":"nmonga91","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16244012?v=3","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.com/nmonga91"},{"username":"Martin Press","avatar_url":null,"user_type":"Anonymous","profile_url":null},{"username":"kaitlin","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/75555?v=3","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.com/kaitlin"},{"username":"kyle-fox","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/654722?v=3","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.com/kyle-fox"},{"username":"afrasier","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6662582?v=3","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.com/afrasier"}],"forks":0,"organization_url":"https://github.com/fedspendingtransparency","project_name":"data-act-validator","org_avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8397762?v=3","repository":"data-act-validator","commits":445,"readme_url":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fedspendingtransparency/data-act-validator/master/README.md","watchers":12,"language":"Python","org_type":"Organization","organization":"fedspendingtransparency"}

Alternately, agencies can take this code and run the broker locally.\n\nThe broker comprises:\n\n* The DATA Act core (you are here)\n* The [broker's application programming interface (API)](https://github.com/fedspendingtransparency/data-act-broker \"DATA Act broker API\")\n* The [DATA Act validator](https://github.com/fedspendingtransparency/data-act-validator \"DATA Act validator\")\n* The [broker website](https://github.com/fedspendingtransparency/data-act-broker-web-app \"DATA Act broker website\")\n\n## What Do I Need to Know?\n\nIf you're from a federal agency that will use Treasury's hosted DATA Act broker, you can probably stop reading here. Instead, visit the [broker's website (coming soon)](# \"DATA Act broker\").\n\nIf you want to install and run the broker locally, read the [installation and setup directions](doc/INSTALL.md \"DATA Act broker installation and setup\").\n\nIf you're doing either of the above but are also interested in the sofware's under-the-hood details, refer to the README.md files in [each project's respository](https://github.com/fedspendingtransparency \"fedspendingtransparency repos\").\n\n## DATA Act Core Details\n\nThe sections below provide some technical details about this repo and about some of the files and databases created during the broker initialization. If you already have the broker up and running (see the [install instructions]((https://github.com/fedspendingtransparency/data-act-core#data-act-broker-installation-and-setup \"Install the DATA Act broker\"))), you won't have to create any of the files or run any of the scripts below. The information is here for those interested in what's happening under-the-hood.\n\n### Database Credentials\n\nInformation about this database is placed in a JSON file in your data-act-core installation: `dataactcore/credentials/dbCred.json`. It contains a JSON dictionary with keys `username`, `password`, `host`, and `port`. Below is an example of what should be in this file:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"username\":\"postgres\",\n    \"password\":\"pass\",\n    \"host\":\"localhost\",\n    \"port\":\"5432\"\n}\n```\n\n### Setup Scripts\n\nAfter creating the Postgres database and credentials file, several setup scripts should be run to create the databases and tables that will be used by the broker. In your data-act-core installation, there will be a folder [dataactcore/scripts/](https://github.com/fedspendingtransparency/data-act-core/tree/configuration/dataactcore/scripts). From within this folder, run the following commands:\n\n```bash\n$ python setupJobTrackerDB.py\n$ python setupErrorDB.py\n```\n\nFinally, to prepare the validator to run checks against a specified set of fields and rules, your `data-act-validator` installation will have a [scripts/](https://github.com/fedspendingtransparency/data-act-validator/tree/configuration/dataactvalidator/scripts) folder containing scripts to create the rule sets for testing, as well as the following database setup scripts that must be run.\n\n```bash\n$ python setupStaging.py\n$ python setupValidationDB.py\n```\n\nFor example: `loadApprop.py` may be run to create the included rule set for testing an appropriations file, or you may replace `appropriationsFields.csv` and `appropriationsRules.csv` with custom versions to run a different set of rules.\n\nIf you want to use an updated list of Treasury Account Symbols for the validator checks, you'll need to get the updated [`all_tas_betc.csv`](https://www.sam.fms.treas.gov/SAMPublicApp/all_tas_betc.csv) file and place that in the [scripts/](https://github.com/fedspendingtransparency/data-act-validator/tree/configuration/dataactvalidator/scripts) folder before running:\n\n```bash\n$ python loadTas.py\n$ python setupTASIndexs.py\n```\n\nOnce these scripts have been run, the databases will contain everything they need to validate appropriations files.\n\n### Data Broker Database Reference\n\nAfter broker setup, there will be five databases:\n\n* `error_data` - Holds file level errors in the `file_status` table, along with information about number of row level errors of each type in the `error_data` table. A complete list of every separate occurrence can be found in the error report csv file.\n* `job_tracker` - Holds information on all validation and upload jobs, including status of jobs and relations between jobs. The `job_status` table is the main place to get this information and provides file name/type, status of the job, the job's associated submission, and the table in which the results are located. The `job_dependency` table details precedence constraints between jobs, giving the job IDs for both the prerequisite and the dependent job.\n* `staging` - Holds records that passed validation. Each file validated will have a table in this database, named based on the job ID. If the `file_status` table in the `error_data` database lists the file as completed, each record in the input file will be present in either this staging table or the error report.\n* `user_manager` - Holds a mapping between user names and user IDs to be used for providing submission history information to a user.\n* `validation` - Contains all the information a submitted file is validated against. The `file_columns` table details what columns are expected in each file type, and the rule table maps all defined single-field rules to one of the columns specified in `file_columns`. The `multi_field_rule` table stores rules that involve a set of fields, but are still checked against a single record at a time. Finally, the `tas_lookup` table holds the set of valid TAS combinations, taken from the TAS csv file discussed in the setup section.\n\n### How It Works\n\nThe DATA Act Core repository is a collection of common components used by other\nDATA Act repositories.  The structure for the repository is as follows:\n\n```\ndataactcore/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 aws/            (Common AWS functions)\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 credentials/    (Database credentials)\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 models/         (ORM models and database interfaces)\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 scripts/        (Database setup scripts)\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 utils/          (JSON helper objects)\n```\n\n#### AWS\n\nThe `aws/` folder contains all of the common code that uses AWS Boto SDK, which requires the AWS CLI to function correctly. The installation instructions for the AWS CLI can be found in the [DATA Act installation guide](https://github.com/fedspendingtransparency/data-act-validator/tree/configuration/README.md#aws-cli-tools).\n\n#### Models\n\nThe `models/` folder contains the object-relational mapping (ORM) definition for all models used in the DATA Act project. When a new table is needed, a new object needs to be defined using the SQLAlchemy object notation. For example, a table with a single column of\ntext and a primary key should be defined as follows.\n\n```python\n\nfrom sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, Text\nfrom sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base\n\nBase = declarative_base()\nclass ExampleTable(Base):\n    __tablename__ = 'example_table'\n\n    example_table_id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)\n    text_field = Column(Text)\n\n```\n\nNote that all new ORM objects must inherit from the `declarative_base` object and have the `__tablename__` field set. For consistency, field and tables names should be in all lower case, separated by `_` between words.\n\nAdditional fields exist on some of the models to enable the automatic population of foreign key relationships. These fields use the `relationship` function to signify a mapping to another table.  More information on SQLAlchemy ORM objects can be found on the [official website](http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/orm/tutorial.html#create-a-schema).\n\nDatabase interfaces are defined for each database used within the project. Each interface inherits base functionality from `BaseInterface` and defines both the database name and credentials file location. Where required, interfaces are extended in the other repositories to add additional functionality.\n\n#### Scripts\n\nThe `scripts/` folder contains various python scripts to setup parts of the DATA Act Core\nrepository for local installation. These scripts are used by the pip install process\nto provide a seamless setup. See the [DATA Act installation guide](https://github.com/fedspendingtransparency/data-act-validator/tree/configuration/README.md#installation) for more details.\nIf needed, these scripts can be run manually to setup an environment.\n\n`configure.py` provides interactive command line prompts to set the S3 bucket JSON and database access credentials. The S3 JSON format can be found in [AWS Setup](#aws-setup).  The databases credentials format can be found in the [Database Setup Guide](#database-setup-guide).\n\nIn addition to the JSON configuration scripts, database creation scripts are located in this folder. When run directly, the following scripts take no parameters and stand up all required tables within each database:\n\n- setupJobTrackerDB (Creates job_tracker database)\n- setupErrorDB      (Creates the error database)\n- setupUserDB       (Creates the user database)\n- setupAllDB        (Creates all of the needed databases)\n\nThe order of execution does not matter, as long as each of them are executed.\n\nTo clean out the databases for testing proposes, the following scripts are also provided:\n\n- clearErrors (Clears error_data and file_status tables)\n- clearJobs (Clears job_dependency, job_status, and submission tables)\n\nThese scripts should **not** be used in a live production environment, as existing queries may hold references to the deleted data.\n\n#### Utils\n\nThe `utils/` folder contains common REST requests and error handling objects.\nThese provide a common way for other repositories to handle requests.\n\nThe `RequestDictionary` class is used throughout the DATA Act repositories to provide a\nseamless method to access both the JSON Body and POST FormData from a REST request.\nFor example, if the following JSON was sent to a REST endpoint:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"data\" : \"value\"\n}\n```\n\nIt would be accessed by:\n\n```json\n\n    requestDictionary = RequestDictionary(request)\n    value = requestDictionary.getValue(\"data\")\n\n```\n\nThe `JsonResponse` object contains methods for automatically encoding a JSON response\nfrom a REST request. Users are able to pass dictionary objects that will be\nautomatically converted to JSON with the correct application headers added.\n\nIn addition, the static `error` method will auto create a JSON response with the current exception stack trace encoded. This is useful in the development environment, but should be disabled in production by setting the static class variable `printDebug` to `false`.\n","stars":2,"contributors_list":[{"username":"jworcestBAH","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11858333?v=3","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.com/jworcestBAH"},{"username":"bsweger","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/540544?v=3","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.com/bsweger"},{"username":"mtpress","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4643648?v=3","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.com/mtpress"},{"username":"nmonga91","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16244012?v=3","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.com/nmonga91"},{"username":"klrBAH","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13200616?v=3","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.com/klrBAH"},{"username":"Martin Press","avatar_url":null,"user_type":"Anonymous","profile_url":null},{"username":"kaitlin","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/75555?v=3","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.com/kaitlin"},{"username":"kyle-fox","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/654722?v=3","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.com/kyle-fox"},{"username":"mab6bf","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4449046?v=3","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.com/mab6bf"},{"username":"kevinli-work","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3594363?v=3","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.com/kevinli-work"}],"forks":0,"organization_url":"https://github.com/fedspendingtransparency","project_name":"data-act-core","org_avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8397762?v=3","repository":"data-act-core","commits":415,"readme_url":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fedspendingtransparency/data-act-core/master/README.md","watchers":18,"language":"Python","org_type":"Organization","organization":"fedspendingtransparency"}

For details about any of the above, please follow the links to their individual README files.\n\n## Using the DATA Act Broker\n\n### Using Treasury's Hosted Broker\n\nIf you're from a federal agency that will use Treasury's hosted DATA Act broker, you can probably stop reading here. Instead, visit the [broker's website](https://alpha-broker.usaspending.gov/ \"DATA Act Broker\") to request a user account.\n\n### Using a Broker Virtual Image (Coming Soon)\n\nIf you want to run the broker locally, the easiest way to get started is to use the self-contained package that includes all code, servers, and dependencies in an isolated virtual image.\n**Coming soon.**\n\n### Installing the Broker Locally\n\nIf you want to install the software on your own machine, follow the instructions on our DATA Broker [contributing guide](doc/CONTRIBUTING.md#data-act-broker-setup-for-developers \"DATA Act contributing guide\"). If you're a developer on the DATA Act team or if you want to contribute to the project, this is the option you want.\n\n**[Local installation directions](doc/CONTRIBUTING.md#data-act-broker-setup-for-developers \"DATA Act contributing guide\")**\n","stars":1,"contributors_list":[{"username":"jworcestBAH","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11858333?v=3","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.com/jworcestBAH"},{"username":"bsweger","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/540544?v=3","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.com/bsweger"},{"username":"nmonga91","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16244012?v=3","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.com/nmonga91"},{"username":"mtpress","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4643648?v=3","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.com/mtpress"},{"username":"cmc333333","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/326918?v=3","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.com/cmc333333"},{"username":"klrBAH","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13200616?v=3","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.com/klrBAH"},{"username":"mab6bf","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4449046?v=3","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.com/mab6bf"},{"username":"Martin Press","avatar_url":null,"user_type":"Anonymous","profile_url":null},{"username":"kaitlin","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/75555?v=3","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.com/kaitlin"},{"username":"kyle-fox","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/654722?v=3","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.com/kyle-fox"},{"username":"afrasier","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6662582?v=3","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.com/afrasier"},{"username":"kevinli-work","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3594363?v=3","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.com/kevinli-work"},{"username":"bahfolkoff","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11528424?v=3","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.com/bahfolkoff"}],"forks":2,"organization_url":"https://github.com/fedspendingtransparency","project_name":"data-act-broker-backend","org_avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8397762?v=3","repository":"data-act-broker-backend","commits":2979,"readme_url":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fedspendingtransparency/data-act-broker-backend/master/README.md","watchers":10,"language":"Python","org_type":"Organization","organization":"fedspendingtransparency"}

It is currently under active development and not stable.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nThis API is built on Python 3.3+, Django, and Django Rest Framework.\n\nAssumptions:\n\n* You're able to install software on your local machine\n* You have git installed on your machine and are able to clone code repositories from GitHub. If this isn't the case, the easiest way to get started is to install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/ \"GitHub desktop\"), available for Windows or Mac.\n* You're familiar with opening a terminal on your machine and using the command line as needed.\n\n### Install PostgreSQL\n\n[PostgreSQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostgreSQL) is an object-relational database management system (ORDBMS) with an emphasis on extensibility and standards-compliance.\n\n1. Download the correct PostgreSQL installer for your operating system from [EnterpriseDB](http://www.enterprisedb.com/products-services-training/pgdownload) (we recommend PostgreSQL 9.4.x).\n2. Run the installer. As you proceed through the installation wizard, note your choices for port number, username, and password. You will need those when creating the `settings.py` file.\n\nMore complete install documentation is available on the PostgreSQL [wiki](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Detailed_installation_guides).\n\n**Note:** If you're setting up the project on Mac OSX, we recommend using [homebrew](http://brew.sh) to install PostgreSQL.\n\n### Install Python and Create Virtual Environment\n\nThe API's backend components currently run on Python 3.x. These instructions will walk you through the process of installing Python and creating a Python-based virtual environment to house the API. A virtual environment will isolate the project and its libraries from those running on your local system and prevent potential conflicts.\n\nIf you already have a Python development environment on your machine and a preferred way of managing it, feel free to skip to the next section. We wrote the directions below for folks who don't have a Python environment up and running yet and need the quickest way to get started.\n\n1. Install Python 3.x:\n    * Windows and OSX users can download a 3.x Python installer here: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/ \"Python installer downloads\")\n    * Linux users can install Python 3.x using their distribution's package manager.\n\n2. Use pip to install virtualenv (pip is Python's package manager and is automatically installed with Python 3.x):\n\n        pip install virtualenv\n3. Use pip to install virtualenvwrapper:\n\n        pip install virtualenvwrapper\n\n4. Tell virtualenvwrapper where on your machine to create virtual environments and add it to your profile. This is a one-time virtualenvwrapper setup step, and the process varies by operating system. [This tutorial](http://newcoder.io/begin/setup-your-machine/ \"Python: setting up your computer\") covers setting up virtualenvwrapper on OSX, Linux, and Windows.\n   For Windows users, there may be extra steps needed.  If you run into an error on the import-module step, move the \"VirtualEnvWrapper\" folder from C:/Python27/Lib/site-packages/Users/*username*/Documents/WindowsPowerShell/Modules/ to C:/Users/*username*/Documents/WindowsPowerShell/Modules/.  Next, in powershell run the command \"set-executionpolicy unrestricted\".  Finally, in the VirtualEnvWrapper directory, open the file \"VirtualEnvWrapperTabExpansion.psm1\" and change \"Function:TabExpansion\" to \"Function:TabExpansion2\" in line 12.\n\n5. Create a virtual environment for the USAspending API. In this example we've named the environment *usaspending-api*, but you can call it anything:\n\n        mkvirtualenv usaspending-api\n\n    **Note:** If you're running multiple versions of Python on your machine, you can make sure your environment is running the correct Python version by pointing to a specific binary\n\n        mkvirtualenv --python=[path to installed Python 3.x executable] usaspending-api\n\n6. You should see some output that looks similar to the example below. Essentially, this command creates and activates a new virtualenv named `usaspending-api` with its own set of Python libraries.  Anything you pip install from this point forward will be installed into the *usaspending-api* environment rather than your machine's global Python environment. Your command line prompt indicates which (if any) virtualenv is active.\n\n **Note:** in the command below, replace `/usr/local/bin/python3.4` with the path to your local Python 3.x executable.\n\n        $ mkvirtualenv --python=/usr/local/bin/python3.4 usaspending-api\n        Running virtualenv with interpreter /usr/local/bin/python3.4\n        New python executable in usaspending-api/bin/python3.4\n        Also creating executable in usaspending-api/bin/python\n        Installing setuptools, pip...done.\n\n        (usaspending-api)$\n\n7. This new environment will be active until you run the `deactivate` command. You can re-activate the environment again at any time by typing `workon usaspending-api`.\n\n### USAspending API Backend\n\nDecide where on your machine you want the USAspending API code to live. From the command line, navigate there and clone the USAspending API repository from GitHub to your local environment:\n\n        $ git clone https://github.com/fedspendingtransparency/usaspending-api.git\n\nNavigate to the USAspending API's main folder:\n\n        $ cd usaspending-api\n\n\nInstall the dependencies.  \n\n        $ pip install -r requirements.txt\n\nNext, configure your local settings. The `settings.py` file will check for an environment variable named `DATABASE_URL`. You can export this variable on the command line, or use a library like [autoenv](https://github.com/kennethreitz/autoenv) to load your environment variables when you `cd` into that directory.\n\nExporting your `DATABASE_URL` environment variable should look something like this:\n\n        $ export DATABASE_URL='postgres://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/NAME'\n\n\nTo test your database connection, try running the migrations that come with the project to set up your tables.\n\n        $ python manage.py migrate\n\nYou should see output that looks like this:\n\n    (usaspending-api):~/usaspending-api$ ./manage.py migrate\n    Operations to perform:\n    Apply all migrations: admin, auth, awards, contenttypes, sessions\n    Running migrations:\n    Applying awards.0001_initial... OK\n\nOnce you've done that, you're ready to start the development server\n\n    $ python manage.py runserver\n\nThis will run the application at `127.0.0.1:8000` by default. You can change that by passing the host and port number in to the `runserver` command.\n\nyou should see something like this:\n\n    Performing system checks...\n    System check identified no issues (0 silenced).\n    September 02, 2016 - 01:46:02\n    Django version 1.10.1, using settings 'usaspending_api.settings'\n    Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/\n    Quit the server with CONTROL-C.\n\nNow, go to `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/awards/` to see the API! There aren't any other urls set up at the moment.\n\n## ETL Process\n\nThe Django server has an ETL process built in as a custom management command. Follow these steps to import data from a data broker database:\n\n  1. Configure the `DATA_BROKER_DATABASE_URL` environment variable. This is the same process as setting up the API backend. Exporting `DATA_BROKER_DATABASE_URL` should look like this:\n  \n  ```\n  $ export DATA_BROKER_DATABASE_URL='postgres://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/NAME'\n  ```\n\n## Public Domain License\n\nThis project is in the public domain within the United States, and copyright and related rights in the work worldwide are waived through the CC0 1.0 Universal public domain dedication.\n\nAll contributions to this project will be released under the CC0 dedication.

Install Node Version Manager\n\nVisit https://github.com/creationix/nvm site for the latest instructions.\n\n``` bash\ncurl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.24.1/install.sh | bash\n```\n\n2.) Install node.\n``` bash \nnvm install stable\n```\n\n3.) Install the required node modules.\n``` bash\nnpm install nodejs -g\nnpm install bower -g\nnpm install compass -g\nnpm install grunt -g\nnpm install grunt-cli -g\n```\n\n4.) Install compass ruby gem (Depending on how your ruby is installed, this may require root).\n``` bash\ngem install compass\n```\n\n5.) Clone the git repos\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/booz-allen-agile-delivery/myAmerica\n```\n\n6.) Run these commands in myAmerica directory\n``` bash\nnpm install\nbower install\n```\n\n7.) Edit the /app/app.js file to include your RIDB Api Key\n\n8.) Start the grunt server.  By default, the site will be hosted on http://0.0.0.0:9000/\n``` bash\ngrunt serve\n```\n\n## Helpful Tips\n\n1.) If you are having problems running bower install, check to make sure the git protocol is not blocked by your firewall.  To configure the default to use https instead of the git protocol, use the following commands:\n\nTo set https as default:\n``` bash\ngit config --global url.\"https://\".insteadOf git://\n```\n\nTo undo global configs:\n``` bash\ngit config --global --unset\n```\n\n2.)

Through labelCRAFT, we are able to determine whether adverse effects reported by consumers are accurately described by the manufacturer on the drug label. By identifying the adverse effects that consumers have reported and are not currently listed on drug labels, we hope to reduce the time it takes for manufacturers to update their labels and better inform consumers.\n\nThe challenge with the label data is that it is unstructured and label sections often vary by manufacturer making it difficult to automate the discovery of adverse effects with technology. Simply finding the adverse effect \u2018words\u2019 on a label is not sufficient to conclude that the manufacturer has accurately described it as a side effect. We felt this challenge is perfect to solve through the power of crowdsourcing. LabelCRAFT is crowd-sourcing platform that asks users questions to assess whether adverse effects reported by consumers (from https://open.fda.gov/drug/label/) are found on the drug label. To ensure the information we collect is used to its full potential, our data is exposed via an API and documented for third-party application developers.\n\nBooz Allen Digital offers key strengths to the GSA 18F for the ADS BPA:\n\n\n- **Demonstrated Agile Delivery** \u2013 Our firm has strong experience with agile software development as demonstrated on this prototype as well as on GSA Integrated Award Environment (IAE), numerous hackathons, and many other federal and commercial engagements.\n\n- **A Culture of Innovation** - Booz Allen's dedication to creating a culture of innovation resulted in the Strategic Innovation Group (SIG), a 1,800 team whose mission it is to ensure there is focus on agile, digital, next gen analytics and cyber security for all modern solutions.\n\n- **Cross-functional agile skilled staff with reach back to domain SME** \u2013 Booz Allen was able to quickly assemble a highly-skilled, cross-functional team for this effort. Booz Allen has deep knowledge of federal agencies missions. For example, for this effort, we engaged FDA domain experts from our firm to help us understand the data and come up with our solution concept.\n\n### Digital Services Playbook\n\nWe closely followed the Digital Services playbook guidelines as detailed in the link below: \n\nhttps://github.com/booz-allen-agile-delivery/ads-final/blob/development/documentation/U.S.-Digital-Services-Playbook-Evidence.md\n\n### Technical Approach Pool Three\n\n**(a)**\n\nWe assigned one leader, our Product Owner (PO), who had the authority, responsibility, and was held accountable for the quality of our labelCRAFT prototype submission. Our PO also had the authority to allocate resources and funding to create the prototype. The PO was responsible for defining the initial prototype concept and attended all release planning, sprint planning and demonstrations. The PO made the decisions about backlog priorities.\n\nOur user stories:\n\nhttps://github.com/booz-allen-agile-delivery/ads-final/blob/development/documentation/User-Stories.md\n\n**(b)**\n\nWe decided that we wanted to build a prototype that not only intuitively displayed data from 2 of the 3 FDA datasets but also included a backend data repository / front end user interface to capture input data for label data crowdsourcing. Given this scope, we assembled a multidisciplinary and collaborative team using 10 of the 13 labor categories (LCATs). The LCATs used were 1) Product Manager, 2) Technical Architect, 3) Interaction Designer/User Researcher/Usability Tester, 4) Writer/Content Designer/Content Strategist, 5) Visual Designer, 6) Frontend Web Developer, 7) Backend Web Developer, 8) DevOps Engineer, 9) Delivery Manager, and 10) Agile Coach.\n\nOur humans.txt file:\n\nhttps://github.com/booz-allen-agile-delivery/ads-final/blob/development/www/app/humans.txt\n\n**(c)**\n\nFrom the beginning of our prototype development, we included \u2018people\u2019 throughout the process to understand their needs and get their feedback on our design and development. On day 1, we led an ideation session with \u201cpeople\u201d (2 Booz Allen FDA Drug and Data SMEs), the PO and the 18F BPA \u201cagile team\u201d. We developed multiple hypotheses about our target audiences and their needs along with sketches of personas which was  validated and updated through in-person and phone-based user interviews and usability testing. \n\nOur human-centered design process:\n\nhttps://github.com/booz-allen-agile-delivery/ads-final/blob/development/documentation/Human-Centered-Design.md\n\n\n**(d)**\n\nWe used 9 core Human Centered Design (HCD) techniques: (1) Visioning exercise to brainstorm target groups, emotional benefits, and features/services to meet their needs; (2) User Interviews; (3) Personas; (4) Journey Mapping; (5) User Stories; (6) Sketching Screen Designs; (7) Rapid Prototyping with clickable Axure Wireframes; (8) Heuristic Reviews based on researched best practices and industry standards for designing for real, live people; (9) Usability Testing in 2 small-scale iterative rounds of moderated, in-person testing.\n\n**(e)**\n\nWe used a bootstrap design style theme that mirrored our vision for the prototype. As we matured our wireframes, we used this design as a foundation but modified the styling to meet our UX needs. We developed a design style guide and provided the team with our core design specifications. We provided wireframes and a set of high fidelity mockups to the developers to implement iteratively.\n\nOur style guide, wireframes, and mockups:\n\nhttps://github.com/booz-allen-agile-delivery/ads-final/blob/development/documentation/Design-Documentation.md\n\n\n**(f)**\n\nWe conducted user interviews and usability tests with \u2018people\u2019 that mapped to each of our hypothesized persona types. We conducted 2 rounds of usability testing (4-5 participants each round) on the wireframes. We moderated in-person usability test sessions where we walked through unstructured impressions on layout, navigation, content and interaction. We made significant changes based on feedback received.\n\nOur usability testing:\n\nhttps://github.com/booz-allen-agile-delivery/ads-final/blob/development/documentation/Usability-Testing.md\n\n\n**(g)**\n\nWe developed labelCRAFT using an iterative approach where feedback informed subsequent versions of the prototype. We had a Sprint \u20180\u2019 followed by 9 Sprints. In Sprint 0, we tailored Booz Allen Digital\u2019s existing agile development tools and environment which includes a continuous delivery infrastructure. We then delivered 6 releases over a period of 6 days. We conducted sprint planning at the beginning of each sprint and conducted a prototype demonstration and retrospective at the end of each sprint. The FDA SMEs and PO attended the planning sessions, the reviews, and provided feedback that informed subsequent work.\n\nOur iterative agile process:\n\nhttps://github.com/booz-allen-agile-delivery/ads-final/blob/development/documentation/Agile-Artifacts.md\n\n\n**(h)**\n\nOur labelCRAFT prototype works on multiple devices and is a responsive design. We implemented our front-end with the Bootstrap framework to provide a completely responsive experience. We conducted usability tests to observe users on these platforms and used Google\u2019s chrome mobile display test tool to emulate the experience of different platforms.\n\nOur responsive design:\n\nhttps://github.com/booz-allen-agile-delivery/ads-final/blob/development/documentation/Responsive-Design.md\n\n\n**(i)**\n\nWe developed labelCRAFT with 14 modern, open source technologies most appropriate to implement the prototype.\n\n- Front-End: Bootstrap, Angular.JS, Node.js, Karma, JS Hint, nvd3\n- Backend: Ruby, Rails, RSpec, Rubocop, Brakeman \n- Dev-Ops: Docker (Machine, Registry, Compose), Jenkins, cAdvisor\n\nOur application stack:\n\nhttps://github.com/booz-allen-agile-delivery/ads-final/blob/development/documentation/Architecture-Diagrams.md\n\n\n**(j)**\n\nWe deployed labelCRAFT on the Amazon Web Service Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) IaaS.  \n\nOur physical deployment model:\n\nhttps://github.com/booz-allen-agile-delivery/ads-final/blob/development/documentation/Architecture-Diagrams.md\n\n\n**(k)**\n\nWe wrote unit tests for code, written with appropriate tooling for the technology stack. We used Karma for front-end code and used rSpec for the backend API. Our unit testing enabled a fluid development process while leveraging the respective language specific advantages of each testing technology. The unit tests were executed both locally and on the continuous integration server (Git push).\n\n**(l)**\n\nWe use Jenkins as our continuous integration system to automate the running of tests and continuously deploy our code. We established GitHub hooks for each branch to kickoff Jenkins jobs. Custom jobs for each branch ran automated tests in containerized environments. Once tests were completed, Jenkins CI updated the Docker registry and deployed the new build. All pushes to the development branch are automatically examined by static code analysis, security scans, unit tests, integration tests, and performance tests. Load testing was performed ad-hoc (developer\u2019s discretion).\n\nOur DevOps workflow:\n\nhttps://github.com/booz-allen-agile-delivery/ads-final/blob/development/documentation/DevOps-Process.md\n\nOur automated testing approach:\n\nhttps://github.com/booz-allen-agile-delivery/ads-final/blob/development/documentation/Automated-Testing.md\n\n\n**(m)**\n\nThe team utilized GitHub for distributed source control.  We leveraged the GitFlow model of propagating code from feature branches, to development, to release, and finally to production. The Docker tool suite allowed seamless containerization and configuration management of the front-end, back-end (API) and database applications.\n\nhttps://github.com/booz-allen-agile-delivery/ads-final/blob/development/documentation/DevOps-Process.md\n\n**(n)**\n\nWe use Sophos and cAdvisor for continuous monitoring. We use Sophos as a security appliance to give us continuous feedback on the state of our solution\u2019s risk posture. It additionally offers security controls to minimize any active cyber threats. We also enforce encryption by default via SSL and use cAdvisor to generate details of our containerized services. Slack is used for team collaboration and integrated with GitHub and Jenkins to help the team keep track of commits and build status.\n\nhttps://github.com/booz-allen-agile-delivery/ads-final/blob/development/documentation/Continuous-Monitoring.md\n\n**(o)**\n\nWe used Docker-engine to build Linux containers from custom Dockerfiles stored in our Git repository. We containerized all 3 tiers of our application stack. We wrote Dockerfiles using Docker\u2019s recommended best practices to maximize the caching features of the Docker tool. This allows for quicker builds, which is important as the Docker image is rebuilt after every push.\n\nhttps://github.com/booz-allen-agile-delivery/ads-final/blob/development/documentation/DevOps-Process.md\n\n**(p)**\n\nInstructions to install and run our prototype on another machine:\n\nhttps://github.com/booz-allen-agile-delivery/ads-final/blob/development/INSTALL.md\n\n**(q)**\n\nWe used all open source technologies and open sourced our LabelCRAFT prototype.\n\nhttps://github.com/booz-allen-agile-delivery/ads-final/blob/development/documentation/Architecture-Diagrams.md\n\nOpen source license:\n\nhttps://github.com/booz-allen-agile-delivery/ads-final/blob/development/LICENSE\n\nLicenses for open source technologies:\n\nhttps://github.com/booz-allen-agile-delivery/ads-final/blob/development/documentation/Licenses.md\n","stars":17,"contributors_list":[{"username":"cevn","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4663020?v=3","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.com/cevn"},{"username":"sami-bah","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11542101?v=3","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.com/sami-bah"},{"username":"bothanus","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12210285?v=3","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.com/bothanus"},{"username":"eraether","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3004951?v=3","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.com/eraether"},{"username":"wbchaf","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8406690?v=3","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.com/wbchaf"},{"username":"stackus","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/158579?v=3","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.com/stackus"},{"username":"willkjackson","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1631162?v=3","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.com/willkjackson"},{"username":"bahfolkoff","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11528424?v=3","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.com/bahfolkoff"},{"username":"dfrasier","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/256019?v=3","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.com/dfrasier"},{"username":"Chris Kacerguis","avatar_url":null,"user_type":"Anonymous","profile_url":null},{"username":"haluksaker","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12210910?v=3","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.com/haluksaker"},{"username":"sjoshi10","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11508957?v=3","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.com/sjoshi10"},{"username":"Debanjan Dasgupta","avatar_url":null,"user_type":"Anonymous","profile_url":null},{"username":"unknown","avatar_url":null,"user_type":"Anonymous","profile_url":null},{"username":"joshi_saurab","avatar_url":null,"user_type":"Anonymous","profile_url":null},{"username":"sweise28","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13038047?v=3","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.com/sweise28"},{"username":"dhars","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11279910?v=3","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.com/dhars"},{"username":"chriskacerguis","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2414647?v=3","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.com/chriskacerguis"},{"username":"lackroneluke","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11546190?v=3","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.com/lackroneluke"},{"username":"wbchaf","avatar_url":null,"user_type":"Anonymous","profile_url":null},{"username":"573104","avatar_url":null,"user_type":"Anonymous","profile_url":null},{"username":"EC2 Default User","avatar_url":null,"user_type":"Anonymous","profile_url":null}],"forks":15,"organization_url":"https://github.com/boozallen","project_name":"ads-final","org_avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7501879?v=3","repository":"ads-final","commits":922,"readme_url":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/boozallen/ads-final/master/README.md","watchers":32,"language":"JavaScript","org_type":"Organization","organization":"boozallen"}

This technique enables fast search of records in a database based on a particular column instead of the row id, thus enabling relational-style semantics in a NoSQL environment. This is accomplished by representing the index either in a reserved namespace in the table or another index table. Despite the fact that this is a common design pattern in BigTable-based applications, most implementations of this practice to date have been tightly coupled with a particular application. As a result, few general-purpose frameworks for secondary indexing on BigTable-like databases exist, and those that do are tied to a particular implementation of the BigTable model.\n\nWe developed a solution to this problem called Culvert that supports online index updates as well as a variation of the HIVE query language. In designing Culvert, we sought to make the solution pluggable so that it can be used on any of the many BigTable-like databases (HBase, Cassandra, etc.). Our goal with Culvert is to make an easy, extensible tool for use in the entire NoSQL community.\n\n## Building ##\n\nRequirements:\n\n1. Java 1.5\n2. Maven 3 (though Maven 2 may work).\n3. Hbase 0.92\n\nTo install:\n\n1.  Pull down the source and run: \"mvn clean package\". This outputs a compiled jar.\n2. Install the jar on the classpath of all the servers hosting your table. \n3. Install the jar on the local server (the 'client') from which to issue requests.\n4. Create an index table and update your configurations\n5. Create an instance of a com.bah.culvert.Client\n6. Write your data into your primary table through the Client.\n\n## Resources ##\n\nAll support resources for Culvert are present under resources/.\nCurrently, the folder consists of:\n\n* CulvertFormat.xml - Formatting for eclipse of the code. \n\tSet this for all the Culvert projects from Preferences > Java > Code Style >Formatter\n\n## Roadmap ##\n\n1. Switch Joins to first attempting to use an in-memory table, server side, before dumping results into a 'scratch' table\n2. Enable higher consistency puts through use of coprocessors in HBase \n    \n    1. Switch to doing the table put before the index\n    2. Actually use CPs to ensure that a put has been made before updating the index (two phase commit)\n3. Adding support for removes (consistent or otherwise)\n4.

The goal of Bahdit\nis to create a modular system of components to support online indexing\nof data in a scalable way that is not currently realized in other\nopen source search solutions.\n\nBahdit uses Accumulo, a distributed key-value database, to store\nthe document indices. The initial version includes a map/reduce\nbased web crawling system that uses map/reduce primarily for parallel\njob control and works partially outside of usual map/reduce paradigms.\nThis may eventually be retooled to better conform to map/reduce\nparadigms and use something like Cascading for job control and coordination.\n\nEventually a storm/message queue based restful indexing api is planned\nas well, which will mimic the Solr restful indexing api.\n\nThe actual index design is a hybrid term-document partitioned index,\nwhich has become popular for many indexing systems based on Accumulo.\nEssentially, a dictionary with term frequencies is used to find\nthe lowest frequency term in a user query. This is used to access\na term partitioned index, which itself contains a document-partitioned\nindex.\n\nDetails\n=======\n\nBahdit has three main components: the map/reduce based web crawler and\nindexing control system, the java search api, and the web search UI.\n\nBuild\n-----\n\nBuild Bahdit by running the `mvn package` command. This will produce jars\nin the various sub-project target directories that can be used to run\nBahdit.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nYou must have Accumulo, Hadoop, and Zookeeper installed and functioning.\n\n### Configuration\n\nSee properties.conf and further details below.\n\n### Ingest\n\nThe Bahdit ingest application can, and should, be run as a user process. No\nreal installation steps are necessary.\n\n### Web UI\n\nThe web UI can be run as a user process, as a system daemon, or in a web\napplication container.\n\nTo run as a user process, simply copy the war to your home directory\nand include the properties.conf file in the classpath using the `-cp` option\nfor java. The war file is runnable, so you can use `java -jar` to run it.\n\nTo run as a system daemon, you will need to create an init script to to start\nthe application. Reference versions of how to do this may be found for\napplications such as Gerrit and Hudson which use a similar deployment strategy.\n\nFollow the usual war file deployment instructions for your application\ncontainer if you wish to deploy the application that way.\n\nRunning\n-------\n\nCurrently there are no bootstrap shell scripts for Bahdit, as a result\nyou must construct your java command invocation by hand. Use java -jar.\nFurther details on constructing java classpaths, for instance, are outside\nof the scope of this readme.\n\nBahdit requires a configuration file to be passed to the various utilities.\nThis can be passed to the web UI by including a file named properties.conf\nin the root of the classpath. The ingest utilities accept the path to a\nfile as their first argument.\n\n### Ingest Utilities\n\nThe ingest jar is an executable jar. Run it using `java -jar`. It includes\nbuilt in help documentation which can be accessed using the --help option.\n\n### Web UI\n\nThe web UI is a runnable war file. You can run it using `java -jar` or\nby uploading it to your favorite JavaEE application container.\n\nBe sure to include a properties.conf file in the root of the application\nclasspath when running the web UI. This can be done from the command line\nusing the `-cp` option for java or in an application container by putting \nthe file in WEB-INF/classes.\n\nA reference properties.conf is included in the source code; the options are\nfairly self-explainatory.\n","stars":4,"contributors_list":[{"username":"ekohlwey","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/472537?v=3","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.com/ekohlwey"},{"username":"Booz Allen Hamilton","avatar_url":null,"user_type":"Anonymous","profile_url":null},{"username":"medined","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43589?v=3","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.com/medined"}],"forks":5,"organization_url":"https://github.com/booz-allen-hamilton","project_name":"bahdit","org_avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/543127?v=3","repository":"bahdit","commits":8,"readme_url":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/booz-allen-hamilton/bahdit/master/README.md","watchers":5,"language":"JavaScript","org_type":"Organization","organization":"booz-allen-hamilton"}

A key element of Spring is infrastructural support at the application\nlevel: Spring focuses on the \"plumbing\" of enterprise applications so that teams\ncan focus on application-level business logic, without unnecessary ties to\nspecific deployment environments.\n\nThe framework also serves as the foundation for [Spring Integration][], [Spring\nBatch][] and the rest of the Spring [family of projects][]. Browse the\nrepositories under the [SpringSource organization][] on GitHub for a full list.\n\n## Downloading artifacts\nSee [downloading Spring artifacts][] for Maven repository information. Unable to\nuse Maven or other transitive dependency management tools? See [building a\ndistribution with dependencies][].\n\n## Documentation\nSee the current [Javadoc][] and [reference docs][].\n\n## Getting support\nCheck out the [Spring forums][] and the [spring][spring tag] and\n[spring-mvc][spring-mvc tag] tags on [Stack Overflow][]. [Commercial support][]\nis available too.\n\n## Issue Tracking\nReport issues via the [Spring Framework JIRA]. Understand our issue management\nprocess by reading about [the lifecycle of an issue][]. Think you've found a\nbug? Please consider submitting a reproduction project via the\n[spring-framework-issues][] GitHub repository. The [readme][] there provides\nsimple step-by-step instructions.\n\n## Building from source\nThe Spring Framework uses a [Gradle][]-based build system. In the instructions\nbelow, [`./gradlew`][] is invoked from the root of the source tree and serves as\na cross-platform, self-contained bootstrap mechanism for the build.\n\n### prerequisites\n\n[Git][] and [OpenJDK 8 early access build 100 or later][JDK8 build]\n\nBe sure that your `JAVA_HOME` environment variable points to the `jdk1.8.0` folder\nextracted from the JDK download.\n\n### check out sources\n`git clone git://github.com/SpringSource/spring-framework.git`\n\n### import sources into your IDE\nRun `./import-into-eclipse.sh` or read `import-into-idea.md` as appropriate.\n> **Note:** Per the prerequisites above, ensure that you have JDK 8 configured\nproperly in your IDE.\n\n### install all spring-\\* jars into your local Maven cache\n`./gradlew install`\n\n### compile and test, build all jars, distribution zips and docs\n`./gradlew build`\n\n... and discover more commands with `./gradlew tasks`. See also the [Gradle\nbuild and release FAQ][].\n\n## Contributing\n[Pull requests][] are welcome; see the [contributor guidelines][] for details.\n\n## Staying in touch\nFollow [@springframework][] and its [team members][] on Twitter.

The government has [\"unlimited rights\"](https://github.com/ngageoint/geowave/blob/master/NOTICE) and is releasing this software to increase the impact of government investments by providing developers with the opportunity to take things in new directions. The software use, modification, and distribution rights are stipulated within the [Apache 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html) license.  \n\n\n## Pull Requests\n\nAll pull request contributions to this project will be released under the Apache 2.0 license.  \n\nSoftware source code previously released under an open source license and then modified by NGA staff is considered a \"joint work\" (see *17 USC \u0015 101*); it is partially copyrighted, partially public domain, and as a whole is protected by the copyrights of the non-government authors and must be released according to the terms of the original open source license.\n\n## *Ultra* Quickstart\n\n### Dependencies: Software and Versions\nThis *ultra* quickstart assumes you have [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/), [Git](http://git-scm.com/), and [Java](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) (>= 1.7) installed on your system and on the path.  \n\nTo view the data (via standard [OGC](http://www.opengeospatial.org/) services) a [GeoServer](http://geoserver.org/) instance >= 2.5 is required due to [GEOT-4587](http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/GEOT-4587).  \n[GeoServer](http://geoserver.org/) 2.5 with [Geotools](http://www.geotools.org/) 11.0 the most tested version.\n\n[Apache Accumulo](http://projects.apache.org/projects/accumulo.html) version 1.5 or greater is required.  1.5.0, 1.5.1, and 1.6.0 have all been tested. \n\n[Apache Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org/) versions 1.x and 2.x *should* all work.  The software has specifically been run on [Cloudera](http://cloudera.com/content/cloudera/en/home.html) CDH4 and [Hortonworks Data Platform](http://hortonworks.com/hdp/) 2.1.   \n\nMapReduce 1 with the new API (org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.*) is used.  Testing is underway against YARN / MR2 and seems to be positive, but well, it's still underway.  \n\n[Java Advanced Imaging](http://download.java.net/media/jai/builds/release/1_1_3/) and [Java Image I/O](http://download.java.net/media/jai-imageio/builds/release/1.1/) are also both required to be installed on the GeoServer instance(s) *as well* as on the Accumulo nodes.  The Accumulo support is only required for certain functions (distributed rendering) - so this may be skipped in some cases.\n\n### Building: Maven!\n\nThere is one dependency - [uzaygezen](https://code.google.com/p/uzaygezen/) (a compact hilbert space filling curve implementation in java) - which is not in maven central.   So let's install that locally first:\n\n    $ svn checkout http://uzaygezen.googlecode.com/svn/tags/uzaygezen-0.2/ uzaygezen-read-only\n\t$ cd uzaygezen-read-only && mvn install\n\nNext, since GeoWave itself isn't currently in maven central we will build and install a local copy\n\n\t$ git clone git@github.com:ngageoint/geowave.git\n\t$ cd geowave && mvn install\n\nIf everything worked as expected you should see something like\n\n    [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    [INFO] Reactor Summary:\n    [INFO]\n    [INFO] geowave-parent ....................................

Accumulo (in 1.5) leverages the Apache VFSClassloader to provide an easy way to do this in one shot - load dependencies out of HDFS.  Unfortunately we have a current bug (**GEOWAVE-28**) where the hdfs URI breaks some SPI injection fixes we have in place.  So until this is addressed you need to distribute this jar (*geowave-gt-0.7.0-accumulo-singlejar.jar*) to each tabled server, on the accumulo classpath ( $ACCUMULO_HOME/lib/ext/  is the default choice ).  \n\n### GeoWave System Integration Test\n\nThe geowave-test module will run end-to-end integration testing on either a configured Accumulo instance or a temporary MiniAccumuloCluster.  It will ingest both point and line features spatially and temporally from shapefiles and test that spatial and spatial-temporal queries match expected results.\n\nA specific Accumulo instance can be configured either directly within this pom.xml or as Java options -DzookeeperUrl=&lt;zookeeperUrl&gt; -Dinstance=&lt;instance&gt; -Dusername=&lt;username&gt; -Dpassword=&lt;password&gt;\n\nIf any of these configuration parameters are left unspecified the default integration test will use a MiniAccumuloCluster created within a temporary directory.  For this to work on Windows, make sure Cygwin is installed and a \"CYGPATH\" environment variable must reference the &lt;CYGWIN_HOME&gt;/bin/cygpath.exe file.  \n\n### Ingest Data\n\n*Coming Soon! With useful details!*\n\n(basically see  geowave-ingest::mil.nga.giat.geowave.ingest.VectorFileIngest for an example that can ingest any geotools supported format) \n\n\n### View in GeoServer\n\n*Coming Soon! With screenshots as well!*\n\n(basically add a GeoWave data store through the add datastore menu and configure the layer like normal)\n","stars":0,"contributors_list":[{"username":"ckras34","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5178768?v=3","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.com/ckras34"},{"username":"rfecher","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5320618?v=3","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.com/rfecher"},{"username":"chrisbennight","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1864782?v=3","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.com/chrisbennight"}],"forks":0,"organization_url":"https://github.com/booz-allen-hamilton","project_name":"geowave","org_avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/543127?v=3","repository":"geowave","commits":39,"readme_url":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/booz-allen-hamilton/geowave/master/README.md","watchers":7,"language":"Java","org_type":"Organization","organization":"booz-allen-hamilton"}

[Check out the live demo](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/).\n\nreveal.js comes with a broad range of features including [nested slides](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#markup), [markdown contents](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#markdown), [PDF export](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#pdf-export), [speaker notes](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#speaker-notes) and a [JavaScript API](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#api). It's best viewed in a browser with support for CSS 3D transforms but [fallbacks](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/wiki/Browser-Support) are available to make sure your presentation can still be viewed elsewhere.\n\n\n#### More reading:\n- [Installation](#installation): Step-by-step instructions for getting reveal.js running on your computer.\n- [Changelog](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/releases): Up-to-date version history.\n- [Examples](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/wiki/Example-Presentations): Presentations created with reveal.js, add your own!\n- [Browser Support](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/wiki/Browser-Support): Explanation of browser support and fallbacks.\n\n## Online Editor\n\nPresentations are written using HTML or markdown but there's also an online editor for those of you who prefer a graphical interface. Give it a try at [http://slid.es](http://slid.es).\n\n\n## Instructions\n\n### Markup\n\nMarkup hierarchy needs to be ``<div class=\"reveal\"> <div class=\"slides\"> <section>`` where the ``<section>`` represents one slide and can be repeated indefinitely. If you place multiple ``<section>``'s inside of another ``<section>`` they will be shown as vertical slides. The first of the vertical slides is the \"root\" of the others (at the top), and it will be included in the horizontal sequence. For example:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"reveal\">\n\t<div class=\"slides\">\n\t\t<section>Single Horizontal Slide</section>\n\t\t<section>\n\t\t\t<section>Vertical Slide 1</section>\n\t\t\t<section>Vertical Slide 2</section>\n\t\t</section>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n```\n\n### Markdown\n\nIt's possible to write your slides using Markdown. To enable Markdown, add the ```data-markdown``` attribute to your ```<section>``` elements and wrap the contents in a ```<script type=\"text/template\">``` like the example below.\n\nThis is based on [data-markdown](https://gist.github.com/1343518) from [Paul Irish](https://github.com/paulirish) modified to use [marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked) to support [Github Flavoured Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown). Sensitive to indentation (avoid mixing tabs and spaces) and line breaks (avoid consecutive breaks).\n\n```html\n<section data-markdown>\n\t<script type=\"text/template\">\n\t\t## Page title\n\n\t\tA paragraph with some text and a [link](http://hakim.se).\n\t</script>\n</section>\n```\n\n#### External Markdown\n\nYou can write your content as a separate file and have reveal.js load it at runtime. Note the separator arguments which determine how slides are delimited in the external file. The ```data-charset``` attribute is optional and specifies which charset to use when loading the external file.\n\nWhen used locally, this feature requires that reveal.js [runs from a local web server](#full-setup).\n\n```html\n<section data-markdown=\"example.md\"  \n         data-separator=\"^\\n\\n\\n\"  \n         data-vertical=\"^\\n\\n\"  \n         data-notes=\"^Note:\"  \n         data-charset=\"iso-8859-15\">\n</section>\n```\n\n#### Element Attributes\n\nSpecial syntax (in html comment) is available for adding attributes to Markdown elements. This is useful for fragments, amongst other things.\n\n```html\n<section data-markdown>\n\t<script type=\"text/template\">\n\t\t- Item 1 <!-- .element: class=\"fragment\" data-fragment-index=\"2\" -->\n\t\t- Item 2 <!-- .element: class=\"fragment\" data-fragment-index=\"1\" -->\n\t</script>\n</section>\n```\n\n#### Slide Attributes\n\nSpecial syntax (in html comment) is available for adding attributes to the slide `<section>` elements generated by your Markdown.\n\n```html\n<section data-markdown>\n\t<script type=\"text/template\">\n\t<!-- .slide: data-background=\"#ff0000\" -->\n\t\tMarkdown content\n\t</script>\n</section>\n```\n\n\n### Configuration\n\nAt the end of your page you need to initialize reveal by running the following code. Note that all config values are optional and will default as specified below.\n\n```javascript\nReveal.initialize({\n\n\t// Display controls in the bottom right corner\n\tcontrols: true,\n\n\t// Display a presentation progress bar\n\tprogress: true,\n\n\t// Display the page number of the current slide\n\tslideNumber: false,\n\n\t// Push each slide change to the browser history\n\thistory: false,\n\n\t// Enable keyboard shortcuts for navigation\n\tkeyboard: true,\n\n\t// Enable the slide overview mode\n\toverview: true,\n\n\t// Vertical centering of slides\n\tcenter: true,\n\n\t// Enables touch navigation on devices with touch input\n\ttouch: true,\n\n\t// Loop the presentation\n\tloop: false,\n\n\t// Change the presentation direction to be RTL\n\trtl: false,\n\n\t// Turns fragments on and off globally\n\tfragments: true,\n\n\t// Flags if the presentation is running in an embedded mode,\n\t// i.e. contained within a limited portion of the screen\n\tembedded: false,\n\n\t// Number of milliseconds between automatically proceeding to the\n\t// next slide, disabled when set to 0, this value can be overwritten\n\t// by using a data-autoslide attribute on your slides\n\tautoSlide: 0,\n\n\t// Stop auto-sliding after user input\n\tautoSlideStoppable: true,\n\n\t// Enable slide navigation via mouse wheel\n\tmouseWheel: false,\n\n\t// Hides the address bar on mobile devices\n\thideAddressBar: true,\n\n\t// Opens links in an iframe preview overlay\n\tpreviewLinks: false,\n\n\t// Transition style\n\ttransition: 'default', // default/cube/page/concave/zoom/linear/fade/none\n\n\t// Transition speed\n\ttransitionSpeed: 'default', // default/fast/slow\n\n\t// Transition style for full page slide backgrounds\n\tbackgroundTransition: 'default', // default/none/slide/concave/convex/zoom\n\n\t// Number of slides away from the current that are visible\n\tviewDistance: 3,\n\n\t// Parallax background image\n\tparallaxBackgroundImage: '', // e.g. \"'https://s3.amazonaws.com/hakim-static/reveal-js/reveal-parallax-1.jpg'\"\n\n\t// Parallax background size\n\tparallaxBackgroundSize: '' // CSS syntax, e.g. \"2100px 900px\"\n\n\n});\n```\n\nNote that the new default vertical centering option will break compatibility with slides that were using transitions with backgrounds (`cube` and `page`). To restore the previous behavior, set `center` to `false`.\n\n\nThe configuration can be updated after initialization using the ```configure``` method:\n\n```javascript\n// Turn autoSlide off\nReveal.configure({ autoSlide: 0 });\n\n// Start auto-sliding every 5s\nReveal.configure({ autoSlide: 5000 });\n```\n\n\n### Dependencies\n\nReveal.js doesn't _rely_ on any third party scripts to work but a few optional libraries are included by default. These libraries are loaded as dependencies in the order they appear, for example:\n\n```javascript\nReveal.initialize({\n\tdependencies: [\n\t\t// Cross-browser shim that fully implements classList - https://github.com/eligrey/classList.js/\n\t\t{ src: 'lib/js/classList.js', condition: function() { return !document.body.classList; } },\n\n\t\t// Interpret Markdown in <section> elements\n\t\t{ src: 'plugin/markdown/marked.js', condition: function() { return !!document.querySelector( '[data-markdown]' ); } },\n\t\t{ src: 'plugin/markdown/markdown.js', condition: function() { return !!document.querySelector( '[data-markdown]' ); } },\n\n\t\t// Syntax highlight for <code> elements\n\t\t{ src: 'plugin/highlight/highlight.js', async: true, callback: function() { hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad(); } },\n\n\t\t// Zoom in and out with Alt+click\n\t\t{ src: 'plugin/zoom-js/zoom.js', async: true, condition: function() { return !!document.body.classList; } },\n\n\t\t// Speaker notes\n\t\t{ src: 'plugin/notes/notes.js', async: true, condition: function() { return !!document.body.classList; } },\n\n\t\t// Remote control your reveal.js presentation using a touch device\n\t\t{ src: 'plugin/remotes/remotes.js', async: true, condition: function() { return !!document.body.classList; } },\n\n\t\t// MathJax\n\t\t{ src: 'plugin/math/math.js', async: true }\n\t]\n});\n```\n\nYou can add your own extensions using the same syntax. The following properties are available for each dependency object:\n- **src**: Path to the script to load\n- **async**: [optional] Flags if the script should load after reveal.js has started, defaults to false\n- **callback**: [optional] Function to execute when the script has loaded\n- **condition**: [optional] Function which must return true for the script to be loaded\n\n\n### Presentation Size\n\nAll presentations have a normal size, that is the resolution at which they are authored. The framework will automatically scale presentations uniformly based on this size to ensure that everything fits on any given display or viewport.\n\nSee below for a list of configuration options related to sizing, including default values:\n\n```javascript\nReveal.initialize({\n\n\t...\n\n\t// The \"normal\" size of the presentation, aspect ratio will be preserved\n\t// when the presentation is scaled to fit different resolutions. Can be\n\t// specified using percentage units.\n\twidth: 960,\n\theight: 700,\n\n\t// Factor of the display size that should remain empty around the content\n\tmargin: 0.1,\n\n\t// Bounds for smallest/largest possible scale to apply to content\n\tminScale: 0.2,\n\tmaxScale: 1.0\n\n});\n```\n\n\n### Auto-sliding\n\nPresentations can be configure to progress through slides automatically, without any user input. To enable this you will need to tell the framework how many milliseconds it should wait between slides:\n\n```javascript\n// Slide every five seconds\nReveal.configure({\n  autoSlide: 5000\n});\n```\n\nWhen this is turned on a control element will appear that enables users to pause and resume auto-sliding. Sliding is also paused automatically as soon as the user starts navigating. You can disable these controls by specifying ```autoSlideStoppable: false``` in your reveal.js config.\n\nYou can also override the slide duration for individual slides by using the ```data-autoslide``` attribute on individual sections:\n\n```html\n<section data-autoslide=\"10000\">This will remain on screen for 10 seconds</section>\n```\n\n\n### Keyboard Bindings\n\nIf you're unhappy with any of the default keyboard bindings you can override them using the ```keyboard``` config option:\n\n```javascript\nReveal.configure({\n  keyboard: {\n    13: 'next', // go to the next slide when the ENTER key is pressed\n    27: function() {}, // do something custom when ESC is pressed\n    32: null // don't do anything when SPACE is pressed (i.e. disable a reveal.js default binding)\n  }\n});\n```\n\n\n### API\n\nThe ``Reveal`` class provides a JavaScript API for controlling navigation and reading state:\n\n```javascript\n// Navigation\nReveal.slide( indexh, indexv, indexf );\nReveal.left();\nReveal.right();\nReveal.up();\nReveal.down();\nReveal.prev();\nReveal.next();\nReveal.prevFragment();\nReveal.nextFragment();\nReveal.toggleOverview();\nReveal.togglePause();\n\n// Retrieves the previous and current slide elements\nReveal.getPreviousSlide();\nReveal.getCurrentSlide();\n\nReveal.getIndices(); // { h: 0, v: 0 } }\n\n// State checks\nReveal.isFirstSlide();\nReveal.isLastSlide();\nReveal.isOverview();\nReveal.isPaused();\n```\n\n### Ready Event\n\nThe 'ready' event is fired when reveal.js has loaded all (synchronous) dependencies and is ready to start navigating.\n\n```javascript\nReveal.addEventListener( 'ready', function( event ) {\n\t// event.currentSlide, event.indexh, event.indexv\n} );\n```\n\n### Slide Changed Event\n\nAn 'slidechanged' event is fired each time the slide is changed (regardless of state). The event object holds the index values of the current slide as well as a reference to the previous and current slide HTML nodes.\n\nSome libraries, like MathJax (see [#226](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/issues/226#issuecomment-10261609)), get confused by the transforms and display states of slides. Often times, this can be fixed by calling their update or render function from this callback.\n\n```javascript\nReveal.addEventListener( 'slidechanged', function( event ) {\n\t// event.previousSlide, event.currentSlide, event.indexh, event.indexv\n} );\n```\n\n\n### States\n\nIf you set ``data-state=\"somestate\"`` on a slide ``<section>``, \"somestate\" will be applied as a class on the document element when that slide is opened. This allows you to apply broad style changes to the page based on the active slide.\n\nFurthermore you can also listen to these changes in state via JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nReveal.addEventListener( 'somestate', function() {\n\t// TODO: Sprinkle magic\n}, false );\n```\n\n### Slide Backgrounds\n\nSlides are contained within a limited portion of the screen by default to allow them to fit any display and scale uniformly. You can apply full page background colors or images by applying a ```data-background``` attribute to your ```<section>``` elements. Below are a few examples.\n\n```html\n<section data-background=\"#ff0000\">\n\t<h2>All CSS color formats are supported, like rgba() or hsl().</h2>\n</section>\n<section data-background=\"http://example.com/image.png\">\n\t<h2>This slide will have a full-size background image.</h2>\n</section>\n<section data-background=\"http://example.com/image.png\" data-background-size=\"100px\" data-background-repeat=\"repeat\">\n\t<h2>This background image will be sized to 100px and repeated.</h2>\n</section>\n```\n\nBackgrounds transition using a fade animation by default. This can be changed to a linear sliding transition by passing ```backgroundTransition: 'slide'``` to the ```Reveal.initialize()``` call. Alternatively you can set ```data-background-transition``` on any section with a background to override that specific transition.\n\n\n### Parallax Background\n\nIf you want to use a parallax scrolling background, set the two following config properties when initializing reveal.js (the third one is optional).\n\n```javascript\nReveal.initialize({\n\n\t// Parallax background image\n\tparallaxBackgroundImage: '', // e.g. \"https://s3.amazonaws.com/hakim-static/reveal-js/reveal-parallax-1.jpg\"\n\n\t// Parallax background size\n\tparallaxBackgroundSize: '', // CSS syntax, e.g. \"2100px 900px\" - currently only pixels are supported (don't use % or auto)\n\n\t// This slide transition gives best results:\n\ttransition: linear\n\n});\n```\n\nMake sure that the background size is much bigger than screen size to allow for some scrolling. [View example](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/?parallaxBackgroundImage=https%3A%2F%2Fs3.amazonaws.com%2Fhakim-static%2Freveal-js%2Freveal-parallax-1.jpg&parallaxBackgroundSize=2100px%20900px).\n\n\n\n### Slide Transitions\nThe global presentation transition is set using the ```transition``` config value. You can override the global transition for a specific slide by using the ```data-transition``` attribute:\n\n```html\n<section data-transition=\"zoom\">\n\t<h2>This slide will override the presentation transition and zoom!</h2>\n</section>\n\n<section data-transition-speed=\"fast\">\n\t<h2>Choose from three transition speeds: default, fast or slow!</h2>\n</section>\n```\n\nNote that this does not work with the page and cube transitions.\n\n\n### Internal links\n\nIt's easy to link between slides. The first example below targets the index of another slide whereas the second targets a slide with an ID attribute (```<section id=\"some-slide\">```):\n\n```html\n<a href=\"#/2/2\">Link</a>\n<a href=\"#/some-slide\">Link</a>\n```\n\nYou can also add relative navigation links, similar to the built in reveal.js controls, by appending one of the following classes on any element. Note that each element is automatically given an ```enabled``` class when it's a valid navigation route based on the current slide.\n\n```html\n<a href=\"#\" class=\"navigate-left\">\n<a href=\"#\" class=\"navigate-right\">\n<a href=\"#\" class=\"navigate-up\">\n<a href=\"#\" class=\"navigate-down\">\n<a href=\"#\" class=\"navigate-prev\"> <!-- Previous vertical or horizontal slide -->\n<a href=\"#\" class=\"navigate-next\"> <!-- Next vertical or horizontal slide -->\n```\n\n\n### Fragments\nFragments are used to highlight individual elements on a slide. Every element with the class ```fragment``` will be stepped through before moving on to the next slide. Here's an example: http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/fragments\n\nThe default fragment style is to start out invisible and fade in. This style can be changed by appending a different class to the fragment:\n\n```html\n<section>\n\t<p class=\"fragment grow\">grow</p>\n\t<p class=\"fragment shrink\">shrink</p>\n\t<p class=\"fragment roll-in\">roll-in</p>\n\t<p class=\"fragment fade-out\">fade-out</p>\n\t<p class=\"fragment current-visible\">visible only once</p>\n\t<p class=\"fragment highlight-current-blue\">blue only once</p>\n\t<p class=\"fragment highlight-red\">highlight-red</p>\n\t<p class=\"fragment highlight-green\">highlight-green</p>\n\t<p class=\"fragment highlight-blue\">highlight-blue</p>\n</section>\n```\n\nMultiple fragments can be applied to the same element sequentially by wrapping it, this will fade in the text on the first step and fade it back out on the second.\n\n```html\n<section>\n\t<span class=\"fragment fade-in\">\n\t\t<span class=\"fragment fade-out\">I'll fade in, then out</span>\n\t</span>\n</section>\n```\n\nThe display order of fragments can be controlled using the ```data-fragment-index``` attribute.\n\n```html\n<section>\n\t<p class=\"fragment\" data-fragment-index=\"3\">Appears last</p>\n\t<p class=\"fragment\" data-fragment-index=\"1\">Appears first</p>\n\t<p class=\"fragment\" data-fragment-index=\"2\">Appears second</p>\n</section>\n```\n\n### Fragment events\n\nWhen a slide fragment is either shown or hidden reveal.js will dispatch an event.\n\nSome libraries, like MathJax (see #505), get confused by the initially hidden fragment elements. Often times this can be fixed by calling their update or render function from this callback.\n\n```javascript\nReveal.addEventListener( 'fragmentshown', function( event ) {\n\t// event.fragment = the fragment DOM element\n} );\nReveal.addEventListener( 'fragmenthidden', function( event ) {\n\t// event.fragment = the fragment DOM element\n} );\n```\n\n### Code syntax highlighting\n\nBy default, Reveal is configured with [highlight.js](http://softwaremaniacs.org/soft/highlight/en/) for code syntax highlighting. Below is an example with clojure code that will be syntax highlighted. When the `data-trim` attribute is present surrounding whitespace is automatically removed.\n\n```html\n<section>\n\t<pre><code data-trim>\n(def lazy-fib\n  (concat\n   [0 1]\n   ((fn rfib [a b]\n        (lazy-cons (+ a b) (rfib b (+ a b)))) 0 1)))\n\t</code></pre>\n</section>\n```\n\n### Slide number\nIf you would like to display the page number of the current slide you can do so using the ```slideNumber``` configuration value.\n\n```javascript\nReveal.configure({ slideNumber: true });\n```\n\n\n### Overview mode\n\nPress \"Esc\" or \"o\" keys to toggle the overview mode on and off. While you're in this mode, you can still navigate between slides,\nas if you were at 1,000 feet above your presentation. The overview mode comes with a few API hooks:\n\n```javascript\nReveal.addEventListener( 'overviewshown', function( event ) { /* ... */ } );\nReveal.addEventListener( 'overviewhidden', function( event ) { /* ... */ } );\n\n// Toggle the overview mode programmatically\nReveal.toggleOverview();\n```\n\n### Fullscreen mode\nJust press \u00bbF\u00ab on your keyboard to show your presentation in fullscreen mode. Press the \u00bbESC\u00ab key to exit fullscreen mode.\n\n\n### Embedded media\nEmbedded HTML5 `<video>`/`<audio>` and YouTube iframes are automatically paused when you navigate away from a slide. This can be disabled by decorating your element with a `data-ignore` attribute.\n\nAdd `data-autoplay` to your media element if you want it to automatically start playing when the slide is shown:\n\n```html\n<video data-autoplay src=\"http://clips.vorwaerts-gmbh.de/big_buck_bunny.mp4\"></video>\n```\n\nAdditionally the framework automatically pushes two [post messages](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window.postMessage) to all iframes, ```slide:start``` when the slide containing the iframe is made visible and ```slide:stop``` when it is hidden.\n\n\n### Stretching elements\nSometimes it's desirable to have an element, like an image or video, stretch to consume as much space as possible within a given slide. This can be done by adding the ```.stretch``` class to an element as seen below:\n\n```html\n<section>\n\t<h2>This video will use up the remaining space on the slide</h2>\n    <video class=\"stretch\" src=\"http://clips.vorwaerts-gmbh.de/big_buck_bunny.mp4\"></video>\n</section>\n```\n\nLimitations:\n- Only direct descendants of a slide section can be stretched\n- Only one descendant per slide section can be stretched\n\n\n## PDF Export\n\nPresentations can be exported to PDF via a special print stylesheet. This feature requires that you use [Google Chrome](http://google.com/chrome).\nHere's an example of an exported presentation that's been uploaded to SlideShare: http://www.slideshare.net/hakimel/revealjs-13872948.\n\n1. Open your presentation with [css/print/pdf.css](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/master/css/print/pdf.css) included on the page. The default index HTML lets you add *print-pdf* anywhere in the query to include the stylesheet, for example: [lab.hakim.se/reveal-js?print-pdf](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js?print-pdf).\n2. Open the in-browser print dialog (CMD+P).\n3. Change the **Destination** setting to **Save as PDF**.\n4. Change the **Layout** to **Landscape**.\n5. Change the **Margins** to **None**.\n6. Click **Save**.\n\n![Chrome Print Settings](https://s3.amazonaws.com/hakim-static/reveal-js/pdf-print-settings.png)\n\n## Theming\n\nThe framework comes with a few different themes included:\n\n- default: Gray background, white text, blue links\n- beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links\n- sky: Blue background, thin white text, blue links\n- night: Black background, thick white text, orange links\n- serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links\n- simple: White background, black text, blue links\n- solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links\n\nEach theme is available as a separate stylesheet. To change theme you will need to replace **default** below with your desired theme name in index.html:\n\n```html\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"css/theme/default.css\" id=\"theme\">\n```\n\nIf you want to add a theme of your own see the instructions here: [/css/theme/README.md](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/master/css/theme/README.md).\n\n\n## Speaker Notes\n\nreveal.js comes with a speaker notes plugin which can be used to present per-slide notes in a separate browser window. The notes window also gives you a preview of the next upcoming slide so it may be helpful even if you haven't written any notes. Press the 's' key on your keyboard to open the notes window.\n\nNotes are defined by appending an ```<aside>``` element to a slide as seen below. You can add the ```data-markdown``` attribute to the aside element if you prefer writing notes using Markdown.\n\nWhen used locally, this feature requires that reveal.js [runs from a local web server](#full-setup).\n\n```html\n<section>\n\t<h2>Some Slide</h2>\n\n\t<aside class=\"notes\">\n\t\tOh hey, these are some notes. They'll be hidden in your presentation, but you can see them if you open the speaker notes window (hit 's' on your keyboard).\n\t</aside>\n</section>\n```\n\nIf you're using the external Markdown plugin, you can add notes with the help of a special delimiter:\n\n```html\n<section data-markdown=\"example.md\" data-separator=\"^\\n\\n\\n\" data-vertical=\"^\\n\\n\" data-notes=\"^Note:\"></section>\n\n# Title\n## Sub-title\n\nHere is some content...\n\nNote:\nThis will only display in the notes window.\n```\n\n## Server Side Speaker Notes\n\nIn some cases it can be desirable to run notes on a separate device from the one you're presenting on. The Node.js-based notes plugin lets you do this using the same note definitions as its client side counterpart. Include the required scripts by adding the following dependencies:\n\n```javascript\nReveal.initialize({\n\t...\n\n\tdependencies: [\n\t\t{ src: 'socket.io/socket.io.js', async: true },\n\t\t{ src: 'plugin/notes-server/client.js', async: true }\n\t]\n});\n```\n\nThen:\n\n1. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)\n2. Run ```npm install```\n3. Run ```node plugin/notes-server```\n\n\n## Multiplexing\n\nThe multiplex plugin allows your audience to view the slides of the presentation you are controlling on their own phone, tablet or laptop. As the master presentation navigates the slides, all client presentations will update in real time. See a demo at [http://revealjs.jit.su/](http://revealjs.jit.su).\n\nThe multiplex plugin needs the following 3 things to operate:\n\n1. Master presentation that has control\n2. Client presentations that follow the master\n3. Socket.io server to broadcast events from the master to the clients\n\nMore details:\n\n#### Master presentation\nServed from a static file server accessible (preferably) only to the presenter. This need only be on your (the presenter's) computer. (It's safer to run the master presentation from your own computer, so if the venue's Internet goes down it doesn't stop the show.) An example would be to execute the following commands in the directory of your master presentation: \n\n1. ```npm install node-static```\n2. ```static```\n\nIf you want to use the speaker notes plugin with your master presentation then make sure you have the speaker notes plugin configured correctly along with the configuration shown below, then execute ```node plugin/notes-server``` in the directory of your master presentation. The configuration below will cause it to connect to the socket.io server as a master, as well as launch your speaker-notes/static-file server.\n\nYou can then access your master presentation at ```http://localhost:1947```\n\nExample configuration:\n```javascript\nReveal.initialize({\n\t// other options...\n\n\tmultiplex: {\n\t\t// Example values. To generate your own, see the socket.io server instructions.\n\t\tsecret: '13652805320794272084', // Obtained from the socket.io server. Gives this (the master) control of the presentation\n\t\tid: '1ea875674b17ca76', // Obtained from socket.io server\n\t\turl: 'revealjs.jit.su:80' // Location of socket.io server\n\t},\n\n\t// Don't forget to add the dependencies\n\tdependencies: [\n\t\t{ src: '//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/socket.io/0.9.10/socket.io.min.js', async: true },\n\t\t{ src: 'plugin/multiplex/master.js', async: true },\n\n\t\t// and if you want speaker notes\n\t\t{ src: 'plugin/notes-server/client.js', async: true }\n\n\t\t// other dependencies...\n\t]\n});\n```\n\n#### Client presentation\nServed from a publicly accessible static file server. Examples include: GitHub Pages, Amazon S3, Dreamhost, Akamai, etc. The more reliable, the better. Your audience can then access the client presentation via ```http://example.com/path/to/presentation/client/index.html```, with the configuration below causing them to connect to the socket.io server as clients.\n\nExample configuration:\n```javascript\nReveal.initialize({\n\t// other options...\n\n\tmultiplex: {\n\t\t// Example values. To generate your own, see the socket.io server instructions.\n\t\tsecret: null, // null so the clients do not have control of the master presentation\n\t\tid: '1ea875674b17ca76', // id, obtained from socket.io server\n\t\turl: 'revealjs.jit.su:80' // Location of socket.io server\n\t},\n\n\t// Don't forget to add the dependencies\n\tdependencies: [\n\t\t{ src: '//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/socket.io/0.9.10/socket.io.min.js', async: true },\n\t\t{ src: 'plugin/multiplex/client.js', async: true }\n\n\t\t// other dependencies...\n\t]\n});\n```\n\n#### Socket.io server\nServer that receives the slideChanged events from the master presentation and broadcasts them out to the connected client presentations. This needs to be publicly accessible. You can run your own socket.io server with the commands:\n\n1. ```npm install```\n2. ```node plugin/multiplex```\n\nOr you use the socket.io server at [http://revealjs.jit.su](http://revealjs.jit.su).\n\nYou'll need to generate a unique secret and token pair for your master and client presentations. To do so, visit ```http://example.com/token```, where ```http://example.com``` is the location of your socket.io server. Or if you're going to use the socket.io server at [http://revealjs.jit.su](http://revealjs.jit.su), visit [http://revealjs.jit.su/token](http://revealjs.jit.su/token).\n\nYou are very welcome to point your presentations at the Socket.io server running at [http://revealjs.jit.su](http://revealjs.jit.su), but availability and stability are not guaranteed. For anything mission critical I recommend you run your own server. It is simple to deploy to nodejitsu, heroku, your own environment, etc.\n\n##### socket.io server as file static server\n\nThe socket.io server can play the role of static file server for your client presentation, as in the example at [http://revealjs.jit.su](http://revealjs.jit.su). (Open [http://revealjs.jit.su](http://revealjs.jit.su) in two browsers. Navigate through the slides on one, and the other will update to match.) \n\nExample configuration:\n```javascript\nReveal.initialize({\n\t// other options...\n\n\tmultiplex: {\n\t\t// Example values. To generate your own, see the socket.io server instructions.\n\t\tsecret: null, // null so the clients do not have control of the master presentation\n\t\tid: '1ea875674b17ca76', // id, obtained from socket.io server\n\t\turl: 'example.com:80' // Location of your socket.io server\n\t},\n\n\t// Don't forget to add the dependencies\n\tdependencies: [\n\t\t{ src: '//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/socket.io/0.9.10/socket.io.min.js', async: true },\n\t\t{ src: 'plugin/multiplex/client.js', async: true }\n\n\t\t// other dependencies...\n\t]\n```\n\nIt can also play the role of static file server for your master presentation and client presentations at the same time (as long as you don't want to use speaker notes). (Open [http://revealjs.jit.su](http://revealjs.jit.su) in two browsers. Navigate through the slides on one, and the other will update to match. Navigate through the slides on the second, and the first will update to match.) This is probably not desirable, because you don't want your audience to mess with your slides while you're presenting. ;)\n\nExample configuration:\n```javascript\nReveal.initialize({\n\t// other options...\n\n\tmultiplex: {\n\t\t// Example values. To generate your own, see the socket.io server instructions.\n\t\tsecret: '13652805320794272084', // Obtained from the socket.io server. Gives this (the master) control of the presentation\n\t\tid: '1ea875674b17ca76', // Obtained from socket.io server\n\t\turl: 'example.com:80' // Location of your socket.io server\n\t},\n\n\t// Don't forget to add the dependencies\n\tdependencies: [\n\t\t{ src: '//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/socket.io/0.9.10/socket.io.min.js', async: true },\n\t\t{ src: 'plugin/multiplex/master.js', async: true },\n\t\t{ src: 'plugin/multiplex/client.js', async: true }\n\n\t\t// other dependencies...\n\t]\n});\n```\n\n## Leap Motion\nThe Leap Motion plugin lets you utilize your [Leap Motion](https://www.leapmotion.com/) device to control basic navigation of your presentation. The gestures currently supported are:\n\n##### 1 to 2 fingers\nPointer &mdash; Point to anything on screen. Move your finger past the device to expand the pointer.\n\n##### 1 hand + 3 or more fingers (left/right/up/down)\nNavigate through your slides. See config options to invert movements.\n\n##### 2 hands upwards\nToggle the overview mode. Do it a second time to exit the overview.\n\n#### Config Options\nYou can edit the following options:\n\n| Property          | Default           | Description\n| ----------------- |:-----------------:| :-------------\n| autoCenter        | true              | Center the pointer based on where you put your finger into the leap motions detection field.\n| gestureDelay      | 500               | How long to delay between gestures in milliseconds.\n| naturalSwipe      | true              | Swipe as though you were touching a touch screen. Set to false to invert.\n| pointerColor      | #00aaff           | The color of the pointer.\n| pointerOpacity    | 0.7               | The opacity of the pointer.\n| pointerSize       | 15                | The minimum height and width of the pointer.\n| pointerTolerance  | 120               | Bigger = slower pointer.\n\n\nExample configuration:\n```js\nReveal.initialize({\n\n\t// other options...\n\n\tleap: {\n\t\tnaturalSwipe   : false,    // Invert swipe gestures\n\t\tpointerOpacity : 0.5,      // Set pointer opacity to 0.5\n\t\tpointerColor   : '#d80000' // Red pointer\n\t},\n\n\tdependencies: [\n\t\t{ src: 'plugin/leap/leap.js', async: true }\n\t]\n\n});\n```\n\n## MathJax\n\nIf you want to display math equations in your presentation you can easily do so by including this plugin. The plugin is a very thin wrapper around the [MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org/) library. To use it you'll need to include it as a reveal.js dependency, [find our more about dependencies here](#dependencies).\n\nThe plugin defaults to using [LaTeX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) but that can be adjusted through the ```math``` configuration object. Note that MathJax is loaded from a remote server. If you want to use it offline you'll need to download a copy of the library and adjust the ```mathjax``` configuration value. \n\nBelow is an example of how the plugin can be configured. If you don't intend to change these values you do not need to include the ```math``` config object at all.\n\n```js\nReveal.initialize({\n\n\t// other options ...\n\n\tmath: {\n\t\tmathjax: 'http://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js',\n\t\tconfig: 'TeX-AMS_HTML-full'  // See http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/config-files.html\n\t},\n\t\n\tdependencies: [\n\t\t{ src: 'plugin/math/math.js', async: true }\n\t]\n\n});\n```\n\nRead MathJax's documentation if you need [HTTPS delivery](http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/start.html#secure-access-to-the-cdn) or serving of [specific versions](http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/configuration.html#loading-mathjax-from-the-cdn) for stability.\n\n\n## Installation\n\nThe **basic setup** is for authoring presentations only. The **full setup** gives you access to all reveal.js features and plugins such as speaker notes as well as the development tasks needed to make changes to the source.\n\n### Basic setup\n\nThe core of reveal.js is very easy to install. You'll simply need to download a copy of this repository and open the index.html file directly in your browser.\n\n1. Download the latest version of reveal.js from <https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/releases>\n\n2. Unzip and replace the example contents in index.html with your own\n\n3. Open index.html in a browser to view it\n\n\n### Full setup\n\nSome reveal.js features, like external markdown and speaker notes, require that presentations run from a local web server. The following instructions will set up such a server as well as all of the development tasks needed to make edits to the reveal.js source code.\n\n1. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)\n\n2. Install [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started#installing-the-cli)\n\n4. Clone the reveal.js repository\n   ```sh\n   $ git clone https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js.git\n   ```\n\n5. Navigate to the reveal.js folder\n   ```sh\n   $ cd reveal.js\n   ```\n\n6. Install dependencies\n   ```sh\n   $ npm install\n   ```\n\n7. Serve the presentation and monitor source files for changes\n   ```sh\n   $ grunt serve\n   ```\n\n8. Open <http://localhost:8000> to view your presentation\n\n   You can change the port by using `grunt serve --port 8001`.\n\n\n### Folder Structure\n- **css/** Core styles without which the project does not function\n- **js/** Like above but for JavaScript\n- **plugin/** Components that have been developed as extensions to reveal.js\n- **lib/** All other third party assets (JavaScript, CSS, fonts)\n\n\n### Contributing\n\nPlease keep the [issue tracker](http://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/issues) limited to **bug reports**, **feature requests** and **pull requests**. If you are reporting a bug make sure to include information about which browser and operating system you are using as well as the necessary steps to reproduce the issue.\n\nIf you have personal support questions use [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/reveal.js).\n\n\n#### Pull requests\n\n- Should follow the coding style of the file you work in, most importantly:\n  - Tabs to indent\n  - Single-quoted strings\n- Should be made towards the **dev branch**\n- Should be submitted from a feature/topic branch (not your master)\n- Should not include the minified **reveal.min.js** file\n\n\n## License\n\nMIT licensed\n\nCopyright (C) 2014 Hakim El Hattab,

It provides weak ordering semantics, and will passively\ntry to re-process uncommitted actions in the background.\n\nAdditionally, Geterdun is able to write to any filesystem in the Hadoop API\nthat supports append operations, so the transaction logs that it uses to\naccomplish this goal can be stored reliably.\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nTo get started, use the `GeterDun.geterDun(...)` factory method create a new\n`GeterDun` instance. There is a method with a short signature and a method with\na longer signature. The method with the short signature will use sane defaults\nfor everything.  Then post events using `GeterDun.geterDun(EVENT event)`.\nPresently events must implement `Writable`, but you can submit a pull request\nto get functionality for other serialization methods :) .\n\nWhy Did You Make This\n---------------------\nI had a project that needed to be able to continue to ingest data while various\ndata stores could potentially be offline due to maintenance. I also did not\nwant yet another server, which itself would be subject to maintenance, monitoring,\nand aggravation. I also did not need anything fancy - whether or not the\nevents commit in order was irrelevant, just that they would in fact eventually\nbe processed.\n\nThere is a dizzying array of message queues available today, but they seemed\nto involve a lot more complication to map to my very simple use case than\nimplementing a straightforward, idempotent write-ahead log and processing\nalgorithm with no ordering guarantees. I was unable to find any similarly\nsimple write ahead logging libraries as well.\n\nI thought about using Kafka, which is in many regards similar (although far\nmore complex), but decided not to mainly because I did not want to begin\noperating Kafka clusters. Kafka would also involve a lot of work for me to\nmanage commit times and replaying, and my use case did not require strong\nordering so that seemed like a lot of hassle.\n\nHow it Works\n------------\nGeterdun creates a very simple write-ahead log format in the directory you\nprovide it. If you don't provide a directory then it will crash.\n\nGeterdun attempts immediately to process an event that is posted to it\nusing the `EventProcessor` that you supply. If the action fails to process,\nthen one of two things happen:\n * If the action fails permenantly, by throwing an exception, then Geterdun\n   will commit the action and forward it to a failure handler. You can\n   specify this as well.\n * If the action fails recoverably, by returning `false` from the `EventProcessor`\n   then Geterdun will attempt to reprocess the action later.\n\nFor each `GeterDun` instance, there is a background thread that is constantly\nscanning the directory for log files that are not fully committed.\n\nWhenever Geterdun fully commits a log, it deletes the file.\n\nIt is possible (although not very likely) for Geterdun to process the same event\ntwice. As a result the processes applied to an event should be idempotent.\n\nLimitations\n-----------\nInstances of the `GeterDun` class assume they do not share directories with other\n`GeterDun`s. If you want to use more than one instance you need to give them\ndifferent directories and think of how you want to coordinate them.\n\nCurrently Geterdun only supports implementations of `Writable` as events. See\nprevious note.\n\nGeterdun resolves logs in memory. If you build up a volume of uncommitted\ntransactions that cannot fit in memory, per write ahead log, Geterdun will not be\nable to recover the logs. This can be alleviated by making log rotations\nmore frequent.\n\nLicense\n-------\nApache 2.0.\n\nSee LICENSE.txt\n","stars":3,"contributors_list":[{"username":"ekohlwey","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/472537?v=3","user_type":"User","profile_url":"https://github.com/ekohlwey"}],"forks":1,"organization_url":"https://github.com/booz-allen-hamilton","project_name":"geterdun","org_avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/543127?v=3","repository":"geterdun","commits":3,"readme_url":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/booz-allen-hamilton/geterdun/master/README.md","watchers":9,"language":"Java","org_type":"Organization","organization":"booz-allen-hamilton"}

First a task's output will be checked if it is in the data cache on disk,\nand if not the task will be executed and the data cached.\n\nSee `seizure/tasks.py` for the custom tasks defined for this project. More specifically the\n`MakePredictionsTask` depends on `TrainClassifierTask`, which means `predict.py` will train\nand dump the classifiers as well as make predictions.\n\n## Run cross-validation\n\n```\n./cross_validation.py\n```\n\nCross-validation set is obtained by splitting on entire seizures.

[License](#license)\n\n## Types\n\n  - [1.1](#1.1) <a name='1.1'></a> **Primitives**: When you access a primitive type you work directly on its value.\n\n    + `string`\n    + `number`\n    + `boolean`\n    + `null`\n    + `undefined`\n\n    ```javascript\n    const foo = 1;\n    let bar = foo;\n\n    bar = 9;\n\n    console.log(foo, bar); // => 1, 9\n    ```\n  - [1.2](#1.2) <a name='1.2'></a> **Complex**: When you access a complex type you work on a reference to its value.\n\n    + `object`\n    + `array`\n    + `function`\n\n    ```javascript\n    const foo = [1, 2];\n    const bar = foo;\n\n    bar[0] = 9;\n\n    console.log(foo[0], bar[0]); // => 9, 9\n    ```\n\n**[\u2b06 back to top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n## References\n\n  - [2.1](#2.1) <a name='2.1'></a> Use `const` for all of your references; avoid using `var`.\n\n  > Why? This ensures that you can't reassign your references (mutation), which can lead to bugs and difficult to comprehend code.\n\n    ```javascript\n    // bad\n    var a = 1;\n    var b = 2;\n\n    // good\n    const a = 1;\n    const b = 2;\n    ```\n\n  - [2.2](#2.2) <a name='2.2'></a> If you must mutate references, use `let` instead of `var`.\n\n  > Why? `let` is block-scoped rather than function-scoped like `var`.\n\n    ```javascript\n    // bad\n    var count = 1;\n    if (true) {\n      count += 1;\n    }\n\n    // good, use the let.\n    let count = 1;\n    if (true) {\n      count += 1;\n    }\n    ```\n\n  - [2.3](#2.3) <a name='2.3'></a> Note that both `let` and `const` are block-scoped.\n\n    ```javascript\n    // const and let only exist in the blocks they are defined in.\n    {\n      let a = 1;\n      const b = 1;\n    }\n    console.log(a); // ReferenceError\n    console.log(b); // ReferenceError\n    ```\n\n**[\u2b06 back to top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n## Objects\n\n  - [3.1](#3.1) <a name='3.1'></a> Use the literal syntax for object creation.\n\n    ```javascript\n    // bad\n    const item = new Object();\n\n    // good\n    const item = {};\n    ```\n\n  - [3.2](#3.2) <a name='3.2'></a> If your code will be executed in browsers in script context, don't use [reserved words](http://es5.github.io/#x7.6.1) as keys. It won't work in IE8. [More info](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/issues/61). It\u2019s OK to use them in ES6 modules and server-side code.\n\n    ```javascript\n    // bad\n    const superman = {\n      default: { clark: 'kent' },\n      private: true,\n    };\n\n    // good\n    const superman = {\n      defaults: { clark: 'kent' },\n      hidden: true,\n    };\n    ```\n\n  - [3.3](#3.3) <a name='3.3'></a> Use readable synonyms in place of reserved words.\n\n    ```javascript\n    // bad\n    const superman = {\n      class: 'alien',\n    };\n\n    // bad\n    const superman = {\n      klass: 'alien',\n    };\n\n    // good\n    const superman = {\n      type: 'alien',\n    };\n    ```\n\n  <a name=\"es6-computed-properties\"></a>\n  - [3.4](#3.4) <a name='3.4'></a> Use computed property names when creating objects with dynamic property names.\n\n  > Why? They allow you to define all the properties of an object in one place.\n\n    ```javascript\n\n    function getKey(k) {\n      return `a key named ${k}`;\n    }\n\n    // bad\n    const obj = {\n      id: 5,\n      name: 'San Francisco',\n    };\n    obj[getKey('enabled')] = true;\n\n    // good\n    const obj = {\n      id: 5,\n      name: 'San Francisco',\n      [getKey('enabled')]: true,\n    };\n    ```\n\n  <a name=\"es6-object-shorthand\"></a>\n  - [3.5](#3.5) <a name='3.5'></a> Use object method shorthand.\n\n    ```javascript\n    // bad\n    const atom = {\n      value: 1,\n\n      addValue: function (value) {\n        return atom.value + value;\n      },\n    };\n\n    // good\n    const atom = {\n      value: 1,\n\n      addValue(value) {\n        return atom.value + value;\n      },\n    };\n    ```\n\n  <a name=\"es6-object-concise\"></a>\n  - [3.6](#3.6) <a name='3.6'></a> Use property value shorthand.\n\n  > Why? It is shorter to write and descriptive.\n\n    ```javascript\n    const lukeSkywalker = 'Luke Skywalker';\n\n    // bad\n    const obj = {\n      lukeSkywalker: lukeSkywalker,\n    };\n\n    // good\n    const obj = {\n      lukeSkywalker,\n    };\n    ```\n\n  - [3.7](#3.7) <a name='3.7'></a> Group your shorthand properties at the beginning of your object declaration.\n\n  > Why? It's easier to tell which properties are using the shorthand.\n\n    ```javascript\n    const anakinSkywalker = 'Anakin Skywalker';\n    const lukeSkywalker = 'Luke Skywalker';\n\n    // bad\n    const obj = {\n      episodeOne: 1,\n      twoJediWalkIntoACantina: 2,\n      lukeSkywalker,\n      episodeThree: 3,\n      mayTheFourth: 4,\n      anakinSkywalker,\n    };\n\n    // good\n    const obj = {\n      lukeSkywalker,\n      anakinSkywalker,\n      episodeOne: 1,\n      twoJediWalkIntoACantina: 2,\n      episodeThree: 3,\n      mayTheFourth: 4,\n    };\n    ```\n\n**[\u2b06 back to top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n## Arrays\n\n  - [4.1](#4.1) <a name='4.1'></a> Use the literal syntax for array creation.\n\n    ```javascript\n    // bad\n    const items = new Array();\n\n    // good\n    const items = [];\n    ```\n\n  - [4.2](#4.2) <a name='4.2'></a> Use Array#push instead of direct assignment to add items to an array.\n\n    ```javascript\n    const someStack = [];\n\n    // bad\n    someStack[someStack.length] = 'abracadabra';\n\n    // good\n    someStack.push('abracadabra');\n    ```\n\n  <a name=\"es6-array-spreads\"></a>\n  - [4.3](#4.3) <a name='4.3'></a> Use array spreads `...` to copy arrays.\n\n    ```javascript\n    // bad\n    const len = items.length;\n    const itemsCopy = [];\n    let i;\n\n    for (i = 0; i < len; i++) {\n      itemsCopy[i] = items[i];\n    }\n\n    // good\n    const itemsCopy = [...items];\n    ```\n  - [4.4](#4.4) <a name='4.4'></a> To convert an array-like object to an array, use Array#from.\n\n    ```javascript\n    const foo = document.querySelectorAll('.foo');\n    const nodes = Array.from(foo);\n    ```\n\n**[\u2b06 back to top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n## Destructuring\n\n  - [5.1](#5.1) <a name='5.1'></a> Use object destructuring when accessing and using multiple properties of an object.\n\n  > Why? Destructuring saves you from creating temporary references for those properties.\n\n    ```javascript\n    // bad\n    function getFullName(user) {\n      const firstName = user.firstName;\n      const lastName = user.lastName;\n\n      return `${firstName} ${lastName}`;\n    }\n\n    // good\n    function getFullName(obj) {\n      const { firstName, lastName } = obj;\n      return `${firstName} ${lastName}`;\n    }\n\n    // best\n    function getFullName({ firstName, lastName }) {\n      return `${firstName} ${lastName}`;\n    }\n    ```\n\n  - [5.2](#5.2) <a name='5.2'></a> Use array destructuring.\n\n    ```javascript\n    const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];\n\n    // bad\n    const first = arr[0];\n    const second = arr[1];\n\n    // good\n    const [first, second] = arr;\n    ```\n\n  - [5.3](#5.3) <a name='5.3'></a> Use object destructuring for multiple return values, not array destructuring.\n\n  > Why? You can add new properties over time or change the order of things without breaking call sites.\n\n    ```javascript\n    // bad\n    function processInput(input) {\n      // then a miracle occurs\n      return [left, right, top, bottom];\n    }\n\n    // the caller needs to think about the order of return data\n    const [left, __, top] = processInput(input);\n\n    // good\n    function processInput(input) {\n      // then a miracle occurs\n      return { left, right, top, bottom };\n    }\n\n    // the caller selects only the data they need\n    const { left, right } = processInput(input);\n    ```\n\n\n**[\u2b06 back to top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n## Strings\n\n  - [6.1](#6.1) <a name='6.1'></a> Use single quotes `''` for strings.\n\n    ```javascript\n    // bad\n    const name = \"Capt. Janeway\";\n\n    // good\n    const name = 'Capt. Janeway';\n    ```\n\n  - [6.2](#6.2) <a name='6.2'></a> Strings longer than 100 characters should be written across multiple lines using string concatenation.\n  - [6.3](#6.3) <a name='6.3'></a> Note: If overused, long strings with concatenation could impact performance. [jsPerf](http://jsperf.com/ya-string-concat) & [Discussion](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/issues/40).\n\n    ```javascript\n    // bad\n    const errorMessage = 'This is a super long error that was thrown because of Batman. When you stop to think about how Batman had anything to do with this, you would get nowhere fast.';\n\n    // bad\n    const errorMessage = 'This is a super long error that was thrown because \\\n    of Batman. When you stop to think about how Batman had anything to do \\\n    with this, you would get nowhere \\\n    fast.';\n\n    // good\n    const errorMessage = 'This is a super long error that was thrown because ' +\n      'of Batman. When you stop to think about how Batman had anything to do ' +\n      'with this, you would get nowhere fast.';\n    ```\n\n  <a name=\"es6-template-literals\"></a>\n  - [6.4](#6.4) <a name='6.4'></a> When programmatically building up strings, use template strings instead of concatenation.\n\n  > Why? Template strings give you a readable, concise syntax with proper newlines and string interpolation features.\n\n    ```javascript\n    // bad\n    function sayHi(name) {\n      return 'How are you, ' + name + '?';\n    }\n\n    // bad\n    function sayHi(name) {\n      return ['How are you, ', name, '?'].join();\n    }\n\n    // good\n    function sayHi(name) {\n      return `How are you, ${name}?`;\n    }\n    ```\n  - [6.5](#6.5) <a name='6.5'></a> Never use eval() on a string, it opens too many vulnerabilities.\n\n**[\u2b06 back to top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n\n## Functions\n\n  - [7.1](#7.1) <a name='7.1'></a> Use function declarations instead of function expressions.\n\n  > Why? Function declarations are named, so they're easier to identify in call stacks. Also, the whole body of a function declaration is hoisted, whereas only the reference of a function expression is hoisted. This rule makes it possible to always use [Arrow Functions](#arrow-functions) in place of function expressions.\n\n    ```javascript\n    // bad\n    const foo = function () {\n    };\n\n    // good\n    function foo() {\n    }\n    ```\n\n  - [7.2](#7.2) <a name='7.2'></a> Function expressions:\n\n    ```javascript\n    // immediately-invoked function expression (IIFE)\n    (() => {\n      console.log('Welcome to the Internet. Please follow me.');\n    })();\n    ```\n\n  - [7.3](#7.3) <a name='7.3'></a> Never declare a function in a non-function block (if, while, etc). Assign the function to a variable instead. Browsers will allow you to do it, but they all interpret it differently, which is bad news bears.\n  - [7.4](#7.4) <a name='7.4'></a> **Note:** ECMA-262 defines a `block` as a list of statements. A function declaration is not a statement. [Read ECMA-262's note on this issue](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/Ecma-262.pdf#page=97).\n\n    ```javascript\n    // bad\n    if (currentUser) {\n      function test() {\n        console.log('Nope.');\n      }\n    }\n\n    // good\n    let test;\n    if (currentUser) {\n      test = () => {\n        console.log('Yup.');\n      };\n    }\n    ```\n\n  - [7.5](#7.5) <a name='7.5'></a> Never name a parameter `arguments`. This will take precedence over the `arguments` object that is given to every function scope.\n\n    ```javascript\n    // bad\n    function nope(name, options, arguments) {\n      // ...stuff...\n    }\n\n    // good\n    function yup(name, options, args) {\n      // ...stuff...\n    }\n    ```\n\n  <a name=\"es6-rest\"></a>\n  - [7.6](#7.6) <a name='7.6'></a> Never use `arguments`, opt to use rest syntax `...` instead.\n\n  > Why? `...` is explicit about which arguments you want pulled. Plus rest arguments are a real Array and not Array-like like `arguments`.\n\n    ```javascript\n    // bad\n    function concatenateAll() {\n      const args = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments);\n      return args.join('');\n    }\n\n    // good\n    function concatenateAll(...args) {\n      return args.join('');\n    }\n    ```\n\n  <a name=\"es6-default-parameters\"></a>\n  - [7.7](#7.7) <a name='7.7'></a> Use default parameter syntax rather than mutating function arguments.\n\n    ```javascript\n    // really bad\n    function handleThings(opts) {\n      // No! We shouldn't mutate function arguments.\n      // Double bad: if opts is falsy it'll be set to an object which may\n      // be what you want but it can introduce subtle bugs.\n      opts = opts || {};\n      // ...\n    }\n\n    // still bad\n    function handleThings(opts) {\n      if (opts === void 0) {\n        opts = {};\n      }\n      // ...\n    }\n\n    // good\n    function handleThings(opts = {}) {\n      // ...\n    }\n    ```\n\n  - [7.8](#7.8) <a name='7.8'></a> Avoid side effects with default parameters\n\n  > Why? They are confusing to reason about.\n\n  ```javascript\n  var b = 1;\n  // bad\n  function count(a = b++) {\n    console.log(a);\n  }\n  count();  // 1\n  count();  // 2\n  count(3); // 3\n  count();  // 3\n  ```\n\n- [7.9](#7.9) <a name='7.9'></a> Never use the Function constructor to create a new function.\n\n  > Why? Creating a function in this way evaluates a string similarly to eval(), which opens vulnerabilities.\n\n  ```javascript\n  // bad\n  var add = new Function('a', 'b', 'return a + b');\n\n  // still bad\n  var subtract = Function('a', 'b', 'return a - b');\n  ```\n\n**[\u2b06 back to top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n## Arrow Functions\n\n  - [8.1](#8.1) <a name='8.1'></a> When you must use function expressions (as when passing an anonymous function), use arrow function notation.\n\n  > Why? It creates a version of the function that executes in the context of `this`, which is usually what you want, and is a more concise syntax.\n\n  > Why not?

These parameters now accept `absent`, `present` and `latest` rather than `true` and `false`. The boolean values are still supported and are equivalent to `present` and `absent` respectively. Support for these boolean parameters is deprecated and will be removed in a later release.\n\n**Version 1.7.10 Notes**\n\nInstallation of python-pip previously defaulted to `false` and was not installed. This default is now `true` and python-pip is installed. To prevent the installation of python-pip specify `pip => false` as a parameter when instantiating the `python` puppet class.\n\n**Version 1.1.x Notes**\n\nVersion `1.1.x` makes several fundamental changes to the core of this module, adding some additional features, improving performance and making operations more robust in general.\n\nPlease note that several changes have been made in `v1.1.x` which make manifests incompatible with the previous version.  However, modifying your manifests to suit is trivial.  Please see the notes below.\n\nCurrently, the changes you need to make are as follows:\n\n* All pip definitions MUST include the owner field which specifies which user owns the virtualenv that packages will be installed in.  Adding this greatly improves performance and efficiency of this module.\n* You must explicitly specify pip => true in the python class if you want pip installed.  As such, the pip package is now independent of the dev package and so one can exist without the other.\n\n## Authors\n\n[Sergey Stankevich](https://github.com/stankevich) | [Shiva
